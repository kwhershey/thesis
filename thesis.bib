    abstract = {The khaen is constructed with free reeds mounted in bamboo pipes and enclosed in a carved hardwood wind chamber. These instruments have traditionally been constructed with simple tools using natural materials, primarily bamboo and wood. Unlike some Asian traditional instruments, the khaen has not undergone modernization, and high quality instruments are still made in the traditional manner by village craftsmen. In the past bamboo could have been used for the reeds as well as the pipes, but metal reeds have been used extensively for some time. Measurements have been made on reeds and pipes from two khaen: one a high quality instrument made in northeastern Thailand and one an inexpensive khaen purchased at an import shop. Analysis and comparison have been made of the physical properties of the bamboo pipes, the composition of the alloys used for the metal reeds, and the mechanical properties of the reed such as the elastic modulus. Comparisons can be made with an earlier published analysis of the properties...},
