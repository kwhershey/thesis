\chapter{Transient and Steady-State Dynamics}

This section is an extension of my previous work entitled ``\textit{Unified analysis of transient and steady-state electrophosphorescence using exciton and polaron dynamics modeling}''.\cite{Hershey2016}

\end{wrapfigure}

As discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:oleds}, modern OLEDs are typically based around Phosphorescent emitters in order to realize 100\% internal efficiencies.\cite{Baldo2000,Baldo1998a,Tsutsui1999,OBrien1999a}
However, these phosphorescent emitters, while allowing emission out of the triplet excitonic state, also suffer from the drawback of a longer exciton lifetime, typically on the order of 10$^{-6}$-10$^{-3}$ s.\cite{Baldo1998a,Holmes2003}
An increased lifetime leads to a larger steady-state triplet exciton density compared to a fluorescent device operating at the same luminance.  
This becomes problematic at the high current densities associated with high brightness due to well documented quenching events.\cite{Reineke2007,Reineke2007a,Reineke2009,Mezyk2005,Kalinowski2002,Song2010,Erickson2014}
These quenching events lead to a reduced quantum efficiency at high-current, and termed the ``Efficiency roll-off''.  


Efficiency roll-off is well attributed to quenching and is ubiquitous to phosphorescent OLED behavior.\cite{Reineke2007,Erickson2014,Murawski2013,Giebink2008c}
While previous works have attributed the roll-off to quenching, they have failed to provide a complete picture of the exciton and charge dynamics within the device.
All of these works have utilized a differential equations model for the exciton dynamics, solved in the steady state.
This becomes apparent when investigating the transient electroluminescnce (EL), where a transient voltage pulse, on the order of 500 ns is applied to the device and the resulting luminance is recorded as a function of time.  
Figure \ref{fig:bad_fit} is an attempt to fit the transient luminance decay using the model presented by Reineke \textit{et al.}\cite{Reineke2007} which well fits the efficiency roll-off.  
Indeed, this is a well known problem with existing models, and previous attempts to model the transient EL have utilized an empirical biexponential function to quantifiy the decay.\cite{Erickson2014,Giebink2008c,Baldo2000a,Zhang2012}
In addition to failing to replicate the luminance decay, no known previous efforts have been made in trying to replicate the experimental transient EL luminance rise.

\label{fig:rz_dependence}
\end{wrapfigure}

In addition to the problems with the transient electroluminescence, the interpretation of the existing model without a full dynamics picture can lead to false predictions.  
Figure \ref{fig:rz_dependence}a shows what a quenching model predicts for the roll-off as a function of increasing recombination zone width.\cite{Erickson2014}
However, even in the most idealized case of a gradient emissive layer device, where no additional interfaces come into play, the predictive model fails to replicate the behavior, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rz_dependence}b.
While this device is of little interest for further investigation due to the extreme thickness, the point stands that this model has glaring assumptions for it's applications.

Both the transient EL and the recombination zone dependence issues arise due to an incomplete picture of the device physics, more specifically in the area of polaron dynamics.  
This work sought to address these issues by including polaron dynamics.  
Since the steady-state solution of existing models is able to accurately replicate steady-state performance, the transient EL is utilized as well as the steady-state solution to ensure that the underlying physics are accurately captured.
A valid solution should be able to accurately fit both regimes using the same model parameter values.
In order to leverage previous work, the archetypical green-emitter tris[2-phenylpyridinato-c$_2$,N]Iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)$_3$) is used for the extensively characterized photophysics.\cite{Baldo2000,Baldo2000a,Tsuboi2006,Adachi2001a,Kawamura2006,Kawamura2005c}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Theory}
\subsection{Exciton Dynamics}
The dominannt processes that influence the exciton population, first formalized by Reineke \textit{et al.}\cite{Reineke2007}, have been identified as natural exciton decay, via radiative and non-radiative processes, triplet-triplet annihilation, triplet-polaron quenching, and exciton generation.\cite{Erickson2014,Song2010}
In triplet-triplet annihilation, two triplets are able to interact, and one exciton transfers its energy to the other, resulting in one molecule relaxing to the ground state and the other forming a hot excited state.
This hot state releases this additional energy to heat and typically relaxes back to the $T_1$ state.  
Triplet-polaron quenching is the interaction of a polaron with a nearby triplet exciton.
Here, one of the charges of the exciton non-radiatively recombines with the polaron of the opposite charge, leaving a remaining loose charge.
Excitons are also subject to field dissociation, but this mechanism is ignored in this work.
Field dissociation is typically observed for fields larger than $2.5 \times 10^6$ V/cm.  
This is near the maximum field used for this study, and would be important to consider for higher voltage characterization.

In agreement with previous models, singlet-triplet exciton intersystem crossing and host-guest exciton energy transfer are assumed to be fast compared to exciton decay.\cite{Reineke2007,Baldo2000a,Turro1991a}
Since these mechanisms are much faster, they will not be rate-limiting processes and can thus be omitted from the differential equations model without sacrificing accuracy.
Within an operational device, electron and hole populations are indistinguishable.
Therefore, the electron ($n_e$) and hole ($n_h$) densities are treated as a single geralized polaron population, $n_{pol}=n_e+n_h$.
For simplicity, the model developed here treats the exciton and polaron populations as spatially uniform and confined to the exciton recombination zone.  An spatial inhomogeneity in exciton and polaron density as well as their overlap is absorbed into the bimolecular rate constants.
It is important to note that due to this assumption, rate constants are a property of the device stack, and not just a material property.
With these assumptions, the dynamic processes determining exciton density ($n_{ex}$) can be summarized in the following one-dimensional rate equation:

\begin{equation}
%\frac{dn_{ex}}{dt} = - \frac{n_{ex}}{\tau}-\frac{1}{2}k_{TT}n_{ex}^2-k_{TP}n_{pol}n_{ex}+G_{ex}
\frac{dn_{ex}}{dt} = - \frac{n_{ex}}{\tau}-\frac{1}{2}\ktt n_{ex}^2-\ktp n_{pol}n_{ex}+G_{ex}
\label{eqn:exciton_rate}
\end{equation}

where $\tau$ is the natural exciton lifetime, determined by the radiative ($k_r$) and non-radiative ($k_{nr}$) decay rates by $\tau=1/(k_r+k_{nr})$, \ktt is the rate constant for triplet-triplet annihilation, \ktp is the rate constant for triplet-polaron quenching, and $G_{ex}$ is the exciton generation rate.  
As this is a one-dimensional model, $G_{ex}$ is a spatially uniform generation rate, a simplifying assumption.
Many studies have modeled the exciton recombination zone profile, relying on material energy levels, as well as mobilities.\cite{Rihani2006,Hassine2001,Hassine2002,Ruhstaller2003,Ruhstaller2001}
While these models are more accurate and explicit, in the way that they capture the physics, they also increase the dimensionality of our model, as well as increasing the parameterization; requiring seperate electron and hole rate equations, mobilities and energy levels for every material.
Even with this increased accuracy of the physical processes, identifying if the predicted exciton recombination zone is accurate requires significant additional measurements.
Since the goal of this work is to provide a functional model to accurately predict the transient and steady-state device behavior, spatially uniform dynamics are assumed.
Here, exciton formation is treated using a Langevin recombination formalism based on the polaron density.\cite{Ruhstaller2003,Pinner1999,Blom1996}

\begin{equation}
G_{ex}=\frac{\kf}{4}n_{pol}^2
\label{eqn:exciton_formation}
\end{equation}

where \kf is the rate constant for exciton formation.  The factor of four accounts for the diversity of the polaron population and assumes that electrons and holes are in equal proportion.  
The accuracy of this prefactor is reduced for imbalanced charge, and is investigated in Section \ref{sec:charge_imbalance}.
For $n_e$:$n_h$ ratios 2:1 or better, less than 20\% error is found in this term.  

\section{Polaron Dynamics}

Previous models for efficiency roll-off have ignored polaron dynamics and assumed that all polarons readily form excitons.  The steady-state polaron density is then modeled using a space charge limited model.\cite{Pope1999}
To attribute physics to this process, a simple picture of polaron dynamics is assumed, consisting of charge injection and transport, exciton formation, and polaron loss.  
In order to preserve our one-dimensionality, polarons must be uniformly distributed.  
Without competing losses in the tranport layers, all injected polarons must eventually reach the emissive layer.  
We further assume that polarons easily enter that emissive layer and that the majority of polaron build up occurs within the emissive layer, rather than the transport layers.
Therefore, the charges injected from the current density, $J$, are uniformly generated in the emissive layer by $G_{pol}=2J/ew$.  Here, $e$ is the electron charge, and the factor of two arises from an assumption of equal charge injection.  In a well balanced device, the measured current forms holes on one side of the device and electrons on the other, and are both injected into the device.  
This is discussed extensively in Section \ref{sec:carrier_injection}
Polaron losses to exciton formation mirror the exciton formation rate presented in Equation \ref{eqn:exciton_formation}, though at twice the rate due to two polarons forming one exciton.

The introduction of polaron loss from the emissive layer through the device without forming excitons is essential to address the limitations of previous models.  
Without this term, peak internal quantum efficiency of all devices is assumed to be 100\% and and the roll-up of efficiency at low current can not be explained.  
In order to capture polaron loss, a first order approximation is made for loss in that only the majority charge carrier can be lost and leaks through the device with a characteristic time, $\tau_l$.
With these mechanisms, the full polaron dynamics can be expressed as:




\begin{equation}
\frac{dn_{pol}}{dt}=\frac{-\kf}{2}n_{pol}^2-\frac{n_{pol}}{\tau_l}+G_{pol}.
\label{eqn:polaron_rate}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Transient Electroluminescence}

In this work, given a full model for polaron dynamics, the model is easiest to solve starting from the application of the current pulse, rather than at peak luminace.
Under pulsed electrical excitation, Equations \ref{eqn:exciton_rate} and \ref{eqn:polaron_rate} can be solved at the beginning of the pulse with the initial conditions $n_{ex}=n_{pol}=0$.  
Upon the application of a voltage pulse, there is a time delay before polarons reach the emissive layer, as evidenced by the delay in luminance turn on.  
This has been previously attributed to charge injection and transport in the emissive layer.\cite{Wei2004}
The injection time varies with device area due to the device capacitance and accounts for the majority of the delay time for large devices.
Transport is dependent on the mobility, as well as the field, which is a function of time due to the device capacitance.  
These times can be well predicted using the following equations:

\begin{equation}
t_{inj}=\tau\log(1-\frac{V_{th}}{V_0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
d=\int_0^{t_{trans}}\mu_0 E_0 \exp \left( \sqrt{\gamma E_0\left[1-\left(1-\frac{V_{th}}{V_0}\right)e^{-t/\tau}\right]}\right)\left[1-\left(1-\frac{V_{th}}{V_0}\right)e^{-t/\tau}\right] dt
\end{equation}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{unified/transport}
\caption{Extracted polaron injection time is shown as a function of voltage along with a fit from the model.}
\label{fig:transport}
\end{wrapfigure}

where $\tau$ is the RC time constant of the device, $V_{th}$ is the voltage injection threshold, $t_{inj}$ is the injection time, $t_{trans}$ is the transport time, $d$ is the tranport layer thickness, $\mu_0$ is the base mobility, $\gamma$ is the field dependent mobility term, $E_0$ is the field and $V_0$ is the voltage.
A prediction of the delay time as well as experimental values are shown in Figure \ref{fig:tranport}.
Interestingly, the functional dependence of the model accurately reproduces the extracted data.
The mismatch in absolute value is due to the use of the geometric capacitance in the model.


After this delay, constant current polaron generation is assumed for the remainder of the voltage pulse to calculate polaron generation.  
When the voltage pulse is removed, $G_{pol}$ goes to 0 and the decay can be solved using Equations \ref{eqn:exciton_rate} and \ref{eqn:polaron_rate}.
This model does allow polarons to continue to form excitons after the voltage has been removed.
In the transient regime, if the pulse width is shorter than $\tau_l$, polarons are not able to traverse the emissive layer during the voltage pulse.  
Once the voltage is removed, there is no longer a driving force for polaron leakage via drift.
Under this assumption, the leakage term in Equation \ref{eqn:polaron_rate} can be ignored.
After the full device behavior is fit, the validity of this assumption can be assessed based on the fit values for $\tau_l$.



\subsection{Efficiency Analysis}

The maximum external quantum efficiency of an OLED is often expressed as\cite{Baldo1998a,Rothberg1996}

\begin{equation}
\eqe=\oc \pl \chi \ef
\label{eqn:eqeSimple}
\end{equation}

where \eqe is the external quantum efficiency, \oc is the out-coupling efficiency, \pl is the photoluminescence efficiency of the emissive molecule, $chi$ is the fraction of excitons that are quantum mechanically allowed to emit (In the case of phosphorescent molecules, $\chi=1$ and $\gamma$ is  typically referred to as the charge balance.
While frequently applied, this expression suffers from two major limitations: first, there is no accounting for losses due to exciton quenching, and second, charge balance losses are not strictly defined.  
Since this equation is intended for the maximum efficiency, further modification would have to be done to account for quenching, as is done in Chapter \ref{sec:integrated_lifetime}.
The charge balance factor, $\gamma$ is typically used as a correction factor to account for differences between the observed \eqe and the other calculated factors in Equation \ref{eqn:eqeSimple}.
It is widely hinted at that charge balance relates to the carrier balance, but no formalism is ever given, so it cannot be calculated.
Given our full dynamics model, we are able to be explicit in both of these areas in a meaningful way.  
The internal quantum efficiency of a device is simply the ratio of the radiative exciton rate to the rate of electron injection, and we can therefore recast Equation \ref{eqn:eqeSimple} as


\begin{equation}
\eqe=\oc \frac{n_{ex}k_r}{G_{pol}/2}.
\label{eqn:eqeReform}
\end{equation}

Note that in this equation, exciton quenching is accounted for in the $n_{ex}$ term because in the steady-state, $n_{ex}$ is reduced according to this quenching, which is competative with $k_r$.
Dynamically, the charge balance factor is the fraction of injected polarons contributing in exciton formation.  
This can be viewed as the efficiency of Equation \ref{eqn:polaron_rate} to form excitons.
Given this interpretation, we will recast the charge balance factor $\gamma$, as an explicitely defined exciton formation efficiency \ef as

\begin{equation}
\ef=\gamma = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\kf n_{pol}}{G_{pol}}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\kf n_{pol}}{\frac{1}{2}\kf n_{pol}+\frac{1}{\tau_l}}
\label{eqn:excitonFormation}
\end{equation}

Equations \ref{eqn:eqeReform} and \ref{eqn:exciton_formation} allow us to rigorously tie \eqe and \ef to dynamic processes within the device in a quantitative manner.

\section{Experimental Details}

Devices used for measurements of transient and steady-state EL had the following structure: ITO (150 nm)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styr- enesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) (40 nm)/tris(4-carbazoyl-9- ylphenyl)amine (TCTA) (30 nm)/10\% tris[2-phenylpyridi- nato-C2,N]Iridium(III) (\irppy) doped in 4,40-Bis(N- carbazolyl)–1,10-biphenyl (CBP) (10 nm)/bathophenanthro- line (Bphen) (30 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). 
Transient PL decays were measured using 60-nm-thick films of CBP doped with 10\% \irppy deposited on quartz slides. 
The hole-only device structure used for steady-state PL quenching measure- ments had the following structure: ITO (150 nm)/PEDOT-PSS (40 nm)/10\% \irppy in CBP (60 nm)/Au (50 nm). The gold cathode was used to prevent electron injection. 
Transient EL measurements were conducted using a voltage pulse generator (HP 8114a) with pulse amplitudes ranging from 5–40V and pulse widths ranging from 250 ns–500 ns with a period 500 ls. 
Luminescence was recorded using a set of collection lenses focused onto a fast photodiode (Thorlabs DET36A). 
The photodiode signal was recorded using an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS5104b). 
Transient PL measurements were collected using a
pulsed nitrogen laser (Optical Building Blocks) with a pulse length of approximately 1 ns and emission wavelength of $\lambda$= 337 nm at a repetition rate of 6 Hz. Laser light was focused on the sample using a series of lenses, with collec- tion carried out using the same techniques already described for transient EL. 
Incident laser power was measured using a Coherent EnergyMax 10MB-HE detector. 
Film thicknesses and optical constants used for modeling the out-coupling efficiency in Eq. (9) were obtained using a J. A. Woollam variable angle spectroscopic elllips- ometer (VASE) using a Cauchy dispersion model.



\section{Exciton Quenching in Photoluminescence}\label{sec:pl_measurements}

Photoluminescence measurements have been previously used to extract the rate constants for triplet-triplet annihilation and triplet-polaron quenching.\cite{Erickson2014,Reineke2007}
This is important because it allows an independent confirmation of the extracted rate constants extracted during the electroluminescence fitting.
The transient photoluminescence exposes the natural exciton lifetime, $\tau$ and at high incident flux, the triplet-triplet annihilation rate constant, \ktt.
This measurement involves an incident laser pulse, in this case, from a 337 nm nitrogen laser, which is able to excite a large exciton population.
The pulse width of the nitrogen laser is ~1ns and is much faster than $\tau$ or \ktt, allowing us to use Equation \ref{eqn:exciton_rate} with the initial boundary condition $n_{ex}=A(E_{\text{pulse}}/hfV)$ where $A$ is the absorbed fraction of photons, $E_{\text{pulse}}$ is the pulse energy, $hf$ is the photon energy and $V$ is the film volume.
Since this is optical only excitation, the other boundary condition is $n_{pol}=0$ and we can ignote Equation \ref{eqn:polaron_rate}.\cite{Reineke2007,Erickson2014,Baldo2000a}
For CBP films doped with \irppy, good agreement with the model is observed across a range on initial exciton densities, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:PL_fitting}(a).
The exciton lifetime, $\tau$ was found to be mostly independent of exciton density and was globally fit to 1.5$\pm$0.2 $\mu s$.  
The triplet-triplet annihilation rate constant appears to be a function of intensity and ranges from $\ktt=2.4\times10^{-13}$ cm$^3$/s at $n_{ex_0}=4.1\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ to $\ktt=6.9\times10^{-14}$ cm$^3$/s at $n_{ex_0}=1.1\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$.
These extracted values and trend with intensity are in good agreement with previous reports.\cite{Reineke2007,Erickson2014,Staroske2007}
It is important to note, that the exciton environment is very important for these values.  
Previous studies have shown that the presence of a metal cathode on top of thhe film can significantly reduce the exciton lifetime by allowing additional non-radiative recombination via surface plasmon coupling.\cite{Song2011}
This becomes important in the comparison of these parameters with those obtained under electroluminescence within a device.
A more representative experiment would have involved a full device stack with cathode, rather than just a film.  
Alas, I did not have that forsight for this experiment.

\label{fig:PL_fitting}
\end{wrapfigure}

Triplet-polaron quenching rate constant measurement is done in single carrier devices as a function of polaron density.  
It is largely uninvestigated as to the differences between electrons and holes, but in previous works, hole only currents are used, a precident which will be followed in this work.\cite{Erickson2014,Reineke2007}
A steady-state exciton population is generated optically, in this case, a 405 nm laser.  
In a single carrier device, a space charge limited current model featuring an exponential trap distribution is often used.\cite{Lampert2002a,Giebink2009a,Pope1999}
This model is employed largely because it fits the obtained current-voltage behavior most closely.  
In reality, a single trap state would be expected, as that is what is introduced by \irppy in a doped film.  
These models are frequently employed, despite their inaccuracies, largely for simplicity.  A more accurate determination of polaron density is discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:polaron_density_measurement}.
However, in a space charge limited model with an exponential trap distribution, the current density voltage relationship can be modeled using

\begin{equation}
V=\left[ \frac{J}{e\mu N_C}d^{2l+}\left( \frac{eN_0k_BT_t}{\epsilon} \right)^l \right]^{\frac{1}{l+1}}=CJ^{\frac{1}{l+1}},
\label{eqn:ktpVoltage}
\end{equation}

where $N_C$ is the density of states at the transport level, $\epsilon$ is the permittivity, $\mu$ is the mobility, $L$ is the device thickness and $l=T_t/T$ with $T_t$ being an experimentally determined characteristic temperature of the trap distribution.  The Polarond density is then given by

\begin{equation}
n_{pol}=eN_c\left(\frac{\epsilon V}{ed^2N_0kT_t}\right)^l.
\label{eqn:kptDensity}
\end{equation}

Combining Equation \ref{eqn:kptDensity} with Equation \ref{eqn:exciton_rate}, the ratio of the steady-state PL intensity (L) to the PL intensity in the absence of polarons (L$_0$) can be written as\cite{Reineke2007}

\begin{equation}
\frac{L(n_{pol}}{L_0}=\frac{1}{1+\tau \ktp n_{pol}}
\label{eqn:ktpFit}
\end{equation}

After fitting the current density-voltage characteristics of the device are fit using Equation \ref{eqn:ktpVoltage}, Equations \ref{eqn:kptDensity} and \ref{eqn:ktpFit} can be used to extract the triplet-polaron rate constant for a given value of $\tau$.  
In this case, we use $\tau$ as extracted from the transient PL measurements.
The fit obtained for a CBP \irppy hole only device is shown in Figure \ref{fig:PL_fitting}b.
This devices utilizes a gold cathode to prevent electron injection and shows minimal exciton formation, as expected.
The organic stack is the same as the emissive layer of the inviestigated device.  
In fitting the current density-voltage characteristics using Equation \ref{eqn:ktpVoltage}, a value of $l=(2.4\pm0.2)$ was found.  
The extracted triplet-polaron quenching rate constant from fitting Equation \ref{eqn:ktpFit} was $\ktp=(2.8\pm0.2)\times 10^{-13}$ cm$^3$/s and is agreement with previous measurements.\cite{Erickson2014,Reineke2007}


\section{Application to Devices}

In order to fit both the steady-state and transient regimes, decisions need to be made as to a methodology for extracting parameters.  
The obvious choice may seem to be to try to produce a global fit by fitting both regimes simultaniously.  
The major draw back of this approach is the value of $\tau_l$.  
Since this is a function of the applied field, this is not single valued and relies on knowing the field dependence.
Additionally, the steady-state provides little insight into the actual quantities of $\tau$, \ktt, \ktp, and \kf, and only the ratio of radiative and non-radiative processes is needed for a quality fit of the efficiency roll-off.
Additionally, within this model, only $n_{ex}$ is experimentally available to fit, and the fit parameters are not independent.
The most obvious example of this is the values of \ktt and \ktp, which have similar impact on the exciton population and similar formulation.  
This makes it near impossible to distinguish a dominant mechanism between these two, and results for exact values of quenching constants need to be considered with caution.
This methodology only gives a net effect of the two quenching mechanisms in total, rather than a true seperate measurement of both quantities as is obtained in the PL quenching measurements, discussed in Section \ref{sec:pl_measurements}.

With these limitations addressed, the method used for this discussion to fit all of the device physics has been carefully considered to achieve the highest parameter sensitivity.
The bimolecular quenching constants are most sensitive to the efficiency roll-off since small changes in the quenching constants make a large impact on the roll-off behavior.
However, the lifetime and exciton formation can only be determined to within a fixed ratio.
In contrast, the exact values of lifetime and exciton formation rate are critical to the behavior of the transient EL while the bimolecular quenching constants are difficult to probe in the current regime investigated.
In order to use these sensitivities, a quenching only model (ignoring $\tau_l$) to fit the normalized efficiency roll-off, such has been previously reported, is used to determine the bimolecular quenching rates, \ktt and \ktp.  
Quenching only models can only fit the normalized \eqe roll-off because without a polaron loss term, \ef is assumed to be 100\% and the exact magnitude of efficiency cannot be reproduced.
Initial values for all parameters, except \kf which is previously unmeasured, are determined by the photoluminescence measurement values.
With these quenching rates fixed, the transient EL is fit using Equations \ref{eqn:exciton_rate} and \ref{eqn:polaron_rate} in order to determine $\tau$ and \kf.
Remember that in the transient regime for short pulses, we can assume that $\tau_l=\infty$ and can be ignored.

With these critical rate constants determined, we will revisit the efficiency as a function of current density.
In the first pass, we ignored the exact value of efficiency and only fit the normalized roll-off.
Now, since we know the other parameters, we can revisit \eqe, now matching the exact profile for all currents, by conducting a point-by-point fit for $k_F$.
This fit for $k_F$ can then be used to calculate \ef and can be compared to a drift model, to assess its validity.
