abstract = {Light‐emitting diodes made with poly(2‐methoxy‐5(2′‐ethyl)hexoxy‐phenylenevinylene) (MEH‐ PPV) using indium‐tin‐oxide (ITO) as anode and Ca as cathode have been examined as they age during operation in a dry inert atmosphere. Two primary modes of degradation are identified. First, oxidation of the polymer leads to the formation of aromatic aldehyde, i.e., carbonyl which quenches the fluorescence. The concomitant chain scission results in reduced carrier mobility. ITO is identified as a likely source of oxygen. The second process involves the formation of localized electrical shorts which do not necessarily cause immediate complete failure because they can be isolated by self‐induced melting of the surrounding cathode metal. We have not identified the origin of the shorts, but once they are initiated, thermal runaway appears to accelerate their development. The ultimate failure of many MEH‐PPV devices occurs when the regions of damaged cathode start to coalesce.},

abstract = {Field-effect transistors made of organic single crystals are ideal for studying the charge transport characteristics of organic semiconductor materials. Their outstanding device performance, relative to that of transistors made of organic thin films, makes them also attractive candidates for electronic applications such as active matrix displays and sensor arrays. These applications require minimal cross-talk between neighbouring devices. In the case of thin film systems, simple patterning of the active semiconductor layer minimizes cross-talk. But when using organic single crystals, the only approach currently available for creating arrays of separate devices is manual selection and placing of individual crystals-a process prohibitive for producing devices at high density and with reasonable throughput. In contrast, inorganic crystals have been grown in extended arrays, and efficient and large-area fabrication of silicon crystalline islands with high mobilities for electronic applications has been reported. Here we describe a method for effectively fabricating large arrays of single crystals of a wide range of organic semiconductor materials directly onto transistor source-drain electrodes. We find that film domains of octadecyltriethoxysilane microcontact-printed onto either clean Si/SiO(2) surfaces or flexible plastic provide control over the nucleation of vapour-grown organic single crystals. This allows us to fabricate large arrays of high-performance organic single-crystal field-effect transistors with mobilities as high as 2.4 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and on/off ratios greater than 10(7), and devices on flexible substrates that retain their performance after significant bending. These results suggest that our fabrication approach constitutes a promising step that might ultimately allow us to utilize high-performance organic single-crystal field-effect transistors for large-area electronics applications.},

To fully exploit the potential of this acceptor molecule with respect to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells, the short circuit current (J(SC)) should be improved to become competitive with the state of the art solar cells. Here, we address factors influencing the J(SC) in blends containing the high voltage absorber Lu(3)N@C(80)-PCBEH in view of both photogeneration but also transport and extraction of charge carriers. We apply optical, charge carrier extraction, morphology, and spin-sensitive techniques. In blends containing Lu(3)N@C(80)-PCBEH, we found 2 times weaker photoluminescence quenching, remainders of interchain excitons, and, most remarkably, triplet excitons formed on the polymer chain, which were absent in the reference P3HT:PC(61)BM blends. We show that electron back transfer to the triplet state along with the lower exciton dissociation yield due to intramolecular charge transfer in Lu(3)N@C(80)-PCBEH are responsible for the reduced photocurrent.},

abstract = {The synthesis and photophysical study of a family of cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes are reported. The iridium complexes have two cyclometalated (CN) ligands and a single monoanionic, bidentate ancillary ligand (LX), i.e., CN2Ir(LX). The CN ligands can be any of a wide variety of organometallic ligands. The LX ligands used for this study were all $\beta$-diketonates, with the major emphasis placed on acetylacetonate (acac) complexes. The majority of the CN2Ir(acac) complexes phosphoresce with high quantum efficiencies (solution quantum yields, 0.1−0.6), and microsecond lifetimes (e.g., 1−14 $\mu$s). The strongly allowed phosphorescence in these complexes is the result of significant spin−orbit coupling of the Ir center. The lowest energy (emissive) excited state in these CN2Ir(acac) complexes is a mixture of 3MLCT and 3($\pi$−$\pi$*) states. By choosing the appropriate CN ligand, CN2Ir(acac) complexes can be prepared which emit in any color from green to red. Simple, systematic changes in the CN ligands, which lead to bathochromic shifts of the free ligands, lead to similar bathochromic shifts in the Ir complexes of the same ligands, consistent with “CN2Ir”-centered emission. Three of the CN2Ir(acac) complexes were used as dopants for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The three Ir complexes, i.e., bis(2-phenylpyridinato-N,C2‘)iridium(acetylacetonate) [ppy2Ir(acac)], bis(2-phenyl benzothiozolato-N,C2‘)iridium(acetylacetonate) [bt2Ir(acac)], and bis(2-(2‘-benzothienyl)pyridinato-N,C3‘)iridium(acetylacetonate) [btp2Ir(acac)], were doped into the emissive region of multilayer, vapor-deposited OLEDs. The ppy2Ir(acac)-, bt2Ir(acac)-, and btp2Ir(acac)-based OLEDs give green, yellow, and red electroluminescence, respectively, with very similar current−voltage characteristics. The OLEDs give high external quantum efficiencies, ranging from 6 to 12.3{\%}, with the ppy2Ir(acac) giving the highest efficiency (12.3{\%}, 38 lm/W, {\textgreater}50 Cd/A). The btp2Ir(acac)-based device gives saturated red emission with a quantum efficiency of 6.5{\%} and a luminance efficiency of 2.2 lm/W. These CN2Ir(acac)-doped OLEDs show some of the highest efficiencies reported for organic light emitting diodes. The high efficiencies result from efficient trapping and radiative relaxation of the singlet and triplet excitons formed in the electroluminescent process.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Simplified phosphorescent organic light-emitting device (PHOLED), which utilizes only two organic layers, showed record-high efficiency when first introduced. It is quite surprising that this device can have such high efficiency without the use of complex carrier and exciton confinement layers that are common in the state-of-the-art PHOLEDs nowadays. Therefore, it is important to understand how good charge balance is in simplified PHOLED and why. In this work, we study the effects of altering charge balance in simplified PHOLED through means of changing layer thickness in the hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL) as well as intentionally doping hole and electron traps in the HTL and ETL, respectively, on device efficiency. The results show that when using high carrier mobility charge transport materials, changing layer thickness does not impact charge balance appreciably. On the other hand, introducing charge traps in a thin layer within the HTL or ETL can, in comparison, influence charge balance more significantly, and proves to be a more effective approach for studying the factors limiting charge balance in these devices. The results reveal that simplified PHOLEDs are generally hole-rich, and that the leakage of electrons to the counter electrode is also a major mechanism behind the poor charge balance and efficiency loss in these devices. In order to optimize charge balance in simplified PHOLED, it is important to reduce hole transport in the device so that e-h ratio can be brought closer to unity, as well as eliminate electron leakage. Finally, we show that by simply using an electron blocking HTL, the effi-ciency of the device can be enhanced by as much as 25{\%}, representing the highest reported for simplified PHOLEDs.},

abstract = {Transient electroluminescence (EL) from polymer light emitting diodes is investigated by measurements of the response to short voltage pulses. The carrier mobility is derived from the delay time between the electrical pulse and the onset of EL, muapproximate to3x10(-4) cm(2)/V s. Bilayer devices with a polyethylene-dioxythiophene (PEDOT), hole injection layer are also studied. The delay time between the electrical pulse and the onset of EL is independent of the thickness of the injection layer, implying that the conducting PEDOT functions as a part of the electrode. When a dc forward bias is applied to the device, the delay time decreases, probably as a result of the shift of the emission zone towards the anode. The EL turn-on depends on the amplitude of the voltage pulse. The data are modeled by an equivalent circuit with a fixed capacitance connected in parallel with a nonlinear resistance. The solution of the differential equation depends on the exact form of the device's I-V curve. Two analytical solutions are provided, and an analysis based on space-charge-limited current is presented. By applying a dc forward bias in advance to precharge the space-charge capacitance, the turn-on response time is reduced to 12 ns. The EL decay consists of two components with time constants of 15 ns and 1 mus. The decay does not depend on either the amplitude of the voltage pulse or the prebias.

abstract = {The main process responsible for the luminance degradation in organic light-emitting diodes OLEDs driven under constant current has not yet been identified. In this paper, we propose an approach to describe the intrinsic mechanisms involved in the OLED aging. We first show that a stretched exponential decay can be used to fit almost all the luminance versus time curves obtained under different driving conditions. In this way, we are able to prove that they can all be described by employing a single free parameter model. By using an approach based on local relaxation events, we will demonstrate that a single mechanism is responsible for the dominant aging process. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that the main relaxation event is the annihilation of one emissive center. We then use our model to fit all the experimental data measured under different driving condition, and show that by carefully fitting the accelerated luminance lifetime-curves, we can extrapolate the low-luminance lifetime needed for real display applications, with a high degree of accuracy},

@article{Sun2006,
abstract = {Lighting accounts for approximately 22 per cent of the electricity consumed in buildings in the United States, with 40 per cent of that amount consumed by inefficient (approximately 15 lm W(-1)) incandescent lamps. This has generated increased interest in the use of white electroluminescent organic light-emitting devices, owing to their potential for significantly improved efficiency over incandescent sources combined with low-cost, high-throughput manufacturability. The most impressive characteristics of such devices reported to date have been achieved in all-phosphor-doped devices, which have the potential for 100 per cent internal quantum efficiency: the phosphorescent molecules harness the triplet excitons that constitute three-quarters of the bound electron-hole pairs that form during charge injection, and which (unlike the remaining singlet excitons) would otherwise recombine non-radiatively. Here we introduce a different device concept that exploits a blue fluorescent molecule in exchange for a phosphorescent dopant, in combination with green and red phosphor dopants, to yield high power efficiency and stable colour balance, while maintaining the potential for unity internal quantum efficiency. Two distinct modes of energy transfer within this device serve to channel nearly all of the triplet energy to the phosphorescent dopants, retaining the singlet energy exclusively on the blue fluorescent dopant. Additionally, eliminating the exchange energy loss to the blue fluorophore allows for roughly 20 per cent increased power efficiency compared to a fully phosphorescent device. Our device challenges incandescent sources by exhibiting total external quantum and power efficiencies that peak at 18.7 +/- 0.5 per cent and 37.6 +/- 0.6 lm W(-1), respectively, decreasing to 18.4 +/- 0.5 per cent and 23.8 +/- 0.5 lm W(-1) at a high luminance of 500 cd m(-2).},

abstract = {In an organic semiconductor, the population of microcavity polariton states occurs via an uncoupled exciton reservoir. Consequently, this results in the inefficient excitation of the upper polariton branch, and a significant population of uncoupled excitons in the active material. Here, an alternate excitation approach is demonstrated that permits the direct population of microcavity polariton states under both electrical and optical excitation without first forming an exciton reservoir. This is realized by introducing a weakly coupled emitter into an optical microcavity containing an organic semiconductor suitable for strong exciton-photon coupling. In contrast to previous work on microcavity polariton luminescence in organic semiconductors, angle-resolved measurements of the photoluminescence and electroluminescence show variations in upper and lower branch emission intensity consistent with the branch photon character. These results confirm that the excitation of the microcavity polariton states is by radiative pumping from the weakly coupled emitter.},

abstract = {The root causes of the differences in electroluminescence stability among phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PHOLEDs) utilizing different emitter guests are studied. The results show that the host material plays a more influential role in limiting device stability in comparison to the guest. During the operation of a PHOLED, the host undergoes aggregation as a result of interactions between the excitons and positive polarons. The rate of this aggregation is found to be the limiting factor for device lifetime and is influenced by the choice of the guest material and its concentration. Finally, it is shown that phase segregation between the host and the guest is an important aspect of the aggregation process. As a result of this segregation, energy transfer from the host to the guest becomes increasingly less efficient, resulting in the observed gradual loss in electroluminescence efficiency in the devices over time. The findings explain why PHOLEDs utilizing different guest materials but otherwise identical material systems can have significantly different lifetimes and provide an answer to a long-lasting question in the field.},

abstract = {A method for studying the degradation of organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) in real time is described. Transparent OLEDs allow for the spatial correlation of cathode topographic images with optical images (transmission, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence) of the devices throughout the degradation process. In this study we focused on the evolution of nonemissive, "dark" spots during device operation. We conclude that the electroluminescent dark spots originate as nonconductive regions at the cathode/organic interface and expand or grow as a result of exposure to atmosphere. We propose a mechanism of dark spot growth involving aerobic oxidation of the cathode/organic interfacial region, leading to a highly resistive, carrier blocking interface at the dark spot locations. No initial defects on the cathode surface, which might be responsible for the formation of dark spots, were detected by atomic force microscopy. Structural changes, such as degradation of organic materials and the cathode surface, occur well after the formation and growth of the dark spots. {\textcopyright}2001 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We present two classes of host materials for blue phosphors. The first are carbazole substituted biphenyls 1-9. In these CBP-type materials the triplets are confined to one half of the molecules by using either twisted biphenyls or by a metalinkage of the carbazoles to the biphenyl. We obtained high triplet energies of 2.95-2.98 eV and high glass transition temperatures in the range of 100-120 °C. OLEDs were fabricated using the host material 6 and the carbene emitter Ir(dbfmi) with pure blue emission at 450 nm. The devices achieved an external quantum efficiency of 8.7{\%} at 100 cd/m2 and 6.1{\%} at 1000 cd/m2. MBPTRZ with an electron transporting biscarbazolyltriazine that is separated from the hole transporting carbazole by a non-conjugated, meta-linked biphenyl unit is an example for a bipolar matrix material. The excellent glass forming properties and the high Tg of 132 °C ensure morphological stability in OLEDs. The meta-linkage and the additional twist at the biphenyl unit, which is achieved by two methyl groups in the 2- and 2'-position of the biphenyl in MBPTRZ leads to a decoupling of the electron accepting and electron donating part and therefore to a high triplet energy of 2.81 eV.

Using a tetracene layer grown in a descending energy cascade on 5,6-diphenyl-tetracene and capped with 5,6,11,12-tetraphenyl-tetracene, where the accessibility of the $\pi$-system in each material is expected to influence the rate of parasitic carrier leakage and charge recombination at the donor/acceptor interface, we observe an increase in open circuit voltage (Voc) of approximately 40{\%} (corresponding to a change of +200 mV) compared to that of a single tetracene donor. Little change is observed in other parameters such as fill factor and short circuit current density (FF = 0.50 ± 0.02 and Jsc = 2.55 ± 0.23 mA/cm2) compared to those of the control tetracene?C60 solar cells (FF = 0.54 ± 0.02 and Jsc = 2.86 ± 0.23 mA/cm2). We demonstrate that this cascade architecture is effective in reducing losses due to polaron pair recombination at donor?acceptor interfaces, while enhancing spectral coverage, resulting in a substantial increase in the power conversion efficiency for cascade organic photovoltaic cells compared to tetracene and pentacene based devices with a single donor layer.},

abstract = {Photophysical properties are reported for a series of cyclometalated platinum and iridium complexes that can serve as photosensitizers for singlet oxygen. The complexes have the formula (C;N)(2)Ir(O;O) or (C;N)Pt(O;O) where C;N is a monoanionic cyclometalating ligand such as 2-(phenyl)pyridyl and 2-(phenyl)quinolyl, and O;O is the ancillary ligand acetylacetonate (acac) or dipivaloylmethane (dpm). Also examined were a series of (N;N)PtMe(2) complexes where N;N is a diimine such as 2,2'-bipyridyl. In general, the cyclometalated complexes are excellent photosensitizers for the production of singlet oxygen, while the (N;N)PtMe(2) complexes were ineffective at this reaction. Quantum yields of singlet oxygen production range from 0.9-1.0 for the cyclometalated Pt complexes and 0.5-0.9 for Ir complexes. Luminescence quenching and singlet oxygen formation of the Ir complexes occurs from a combination of electron and energy transfer processes, whereas the Pt complexes only react by energy transfer. For Ir complexes with low emission energy, physical deactivation of the triplet excited state becomes competitive with energy transfer to ground state dioxygen. The rates of singlet oxygen quenching for the complexes presented here are in the range 6 x 10(6)-2 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1) for Pt complexes and 2 x 10(5)-2 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1) for Ir complexes, respectively. Differences in the efficiency of both forming and quenching singlet oxygen between the Ir and Pt cyclometalates are believed to come about from the more exposed coordination geometry in the latter species.},

@article{Davids1997,
abstract = {We present a unified device model for single layer organic light emitting diodes (LEDs) which includes charge injection, transport, and space charge effects in the organic material. The model can describe both injection limited and space charge limited current flow and the transition between them. We specifically considered cases in which the energy barrier to injection of electrons is much larger than that for holes so that holes dominate the current flow in the device. Charge injection into the organic material occurs by thermionic emission and by tunneling. For Schottky energy barriers less than about 0.3-0.4 eV, for typical organic LED device parameters, the current flow is space charge limited and the electric field in the structure is highly nonuniform. For larger energy barriers the current flow is injection limited. In the injection limited regime, the net injected charge is relatively small, the electric field is nearly uniform, and space charge effects are not important. At smaller bias in the injection limited regime, thermionic emission is the dominant injection mechanism. For this case the thermionic emission injection current and a backward flowing interface recombination current, which is the time reversed process of thermionic emission, combine to establish a quasi-equilibrium carrier density. The quasi-equilibrium density is bias dependent because of image force lowering of the injection barrier. The net device current is determined by the drift of these carriers in the nearly constant electric field. The net device current is much smaller than either the thermionic emission or interface recombination current which nearly cancel. At higher bias, injection is dominated by tunneling. The bias at which tunneling exceeds thermionic emission depends on the size of the Schottky energy barrier. When tunneling is the dominant injection mechanism, a combination of tunneling injection current and the backflowing interface recombination current combine to establish the carrier density. We compare the model results with experimental measurements on devices fabricated using the electroluminescent conjugated polymer poly[2-methoxy, 5-(2{\^{a}}€²-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] which by changing the contacts can show either injection limited behavior or space charge limited behavior. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A numerical study of space charge effects in multilayerorganic light-emitting diodes(OLEDs) is presented. The method of solving the coupled Poisson and continuity equations, previously established for single-layer polymer LEDs, has been extended to treat internal organic interfaces. In addition, we consider the transient current and electroluminescence response. We discuss the accumulation of charges at internal interfaces and their signature in the transient response as well as the electric field distribution. Comparison to experimental transient data of a typical bilayer LED based on tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum ( Alq 3 ) is provided and good agreement is found. Our results are consistent with commonly assumed operating principles of bilayer LEDs. In particular, the assumptions that the electric field is predominantly dropped across the Alq 3 layer and that the electroluminescence delay time is determined by electrons passing through Alq 3 to the internal interface are self-consistently supported by the results of the simulation. Moreover, the creation of emissive singlet excitons is found to be strongly confined to the Alq 3 side of the internal interface and the emission zone width is dictated by the excitondiffusion length. Design principles for trilayerLEDs with improved power efficiency are also discussed.},

abstract = {Discovering new OLED emitters requires many experiments to synthesize candidates and test performance in devices. Large scale computer simulation can greatly speed this search process but the problem remains challenging enough that brute force application of massive computing power is not enough to successfully identify novel structures. We report a successful High Throughput Virtual Screening study that leveraged a range of methods to optimize the search process. The generation of candidate structures was constrained to contain combinatorial explosion. Simulations were tuned to the specific problem and calibrated with experimental results. Experimentalists and theorists actively collaborated such that experimental feedback was regularly utilized to update and shape the computational search. Supervised machine learning methods prioritized candidate structures prior to quantum chemistry simulation to prevent wasting compute on likely poor performers. With this combination of techniques, each multiplying the strength of the search, this effort managed to navigate an area of molecular space and identify hundreds of promising OLED candidate structures. An experimentally validated selection of this set shows emitters with external quantum efficiencies as high as 22{\%}.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of the operational lifetime of organic light-emitting diodes(OLEDs) in practical applications, little is known about the nature of chemical reactions associated with efficiency losses during operation. To gain an insight into a chemical mechanism of operational degradation, we studied operation-induced changes in chemical compositions of fluorescent and phosphorescent OLEDs utilizing carbazole derivatives in emissive layers. We detected substantial losses of the emissive components, including the carbazole-derived host 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (CBP) and, if present, phosphorescent dopant. Several different materials were found only in the degraded OLEDs, and some of them were isolated and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. A similar set of products was found upon UV irradiation of CBP films. Structures of degradation products suggest that the key step in operational degradation of OLEDs is homolytic cleavage of weaker bonds, e.g., an exocyclic C–N bond in CBP, in the excited state, followed by radical addition reactions to yield stabilized $\pi$ radicals. Overall, OLED operation leads to the accumulation of the neutral radical species and their reduced or oxidized forms, acting as nonradiative recombination centers and luminescence quenchers.},

Using bis(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III) acetylacetonate (ppy)(2)Ir(acac) doped into 3-phenyl-4(1'-naphthyl)-5-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole, a maximum external quantum efficiency of (19.0 +/-1.0){\%} and luminous power efficiency of (60 +/-5) lm/W are achieved. The calculated internal quantum efficiency of (87 +/-7){\%} is supported by the observed absence of thermally activated nonradiative loss in the photoluminescent efficiency of (ppy)(2)Ir(acac). Thus, very high external quantum efficiencies are due to the nearly 100{\%} internal phosphorescence efficiency of (ppy)(2)Ir(acac) coupled with balanced hole and electron injection, and triplet exciton confinement within the light-emitting layer.

This leads to a conclusion that AlQ3 cations are unstable, and to our proposal that the same mechanism is responsible for degradation of organic light-emitting devices OLEDs based on AlQ3. In this communication, we broaden our studies to include simultaneous electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements on OLEDs containing thin AlQ3 as the emitter layer. Results show that the decrease in the electroluminescence efficiency is indeed associated with degradation of the AlQ3 in the vicinity of the hole transport layer interface.},

Poly[(oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate]-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (POEGMA-b-PMMA) diblock copolymers of different compositions were created via RAFT polymerization using an alkyne terminated macro chain transfer agent (CTA). 2-Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) was modified with azide groups and the diblock copolymers were attached to the backbone via the copper-catalyzed click reaction to yield HEC-g-(POEGMA-b-PMMA) graft terpolymers. The resulting conjugates were soluble in DMF and able to form hydrogels upon simple solvent exchange in water. By increasing the concentration of the conjugates in DMF, the storage moduli of the hydrogels increased and the pore size in the gel decreased. After hydrogel formation, the structures were also found to be nonswellable (no macroscopic volume change upon incubation in water), which is an important feature for retaining size and mechanical integrity of the gels over time. Moreover, these materials were able to be electrospun into fibers that, upon hydration, formed fibrous hydrogel structures. The nonswellable and tunable mechanical properties of these materials imply great potential for a variety of applications such as personal care, active delivery, and tissue engineering.},

The power efficiency and lifetime of this white OLED were reportedly only {\textless}1 lm W-1 and {\textless}1 day, respectively. However, recent rapid advances in material chemistry have enabled the use of white OLEDs for general lighting. In 2012, white OLED panel efficiency has reached 90 lm W-1 at 1000 cd m-2, and a tandem white OLED panel has realized a lifetime of over 100 000 hours. What is more important in OLEDs is to shed clear light on the new design products, such as transparent lighting panels and luminescent wallpapers. These fascinating features enable OLEDs as a whole new invention of artificial lighting. In this review, we would like to overview the recent developments of white OLED, especially three key elemental technologies related to material chemistry: (1) low operating voltage technology, (2) phosphorescent OLED technology and (3) multi-photon emission (MPE) device technology.},

abstract = {The development of white organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) holds great promise for the production of highly efficient large-area light sources. High internal quantum efficiencies for the conversion of electrical energy to light have been realized. Nevertheless, the overall device power efficiencies are still considerably below the 60-70 lumens per watt of fluorescent tubes, which is the current benchmark for novel light sources. Although some reports about highly power-efficient white OLEDs exist, details about structure and the measurement conditions of these structures have not been fully disclosed: the highest power efficiency reported in the scientific literature is 44 lm W(-1) (ref. 7). Here we report an improved OLED structure which reaches fluorescent tube efficiency. By combining a carefully chosen emitter layer with high-refractive-index substrates, and using a periodic outcoupling structure, we achieve a device power efficiency of 90 lm W(-1) at 1,000 candelas per square metre. This efficiency has the potential to be raised to 124 lm W(-1) if the light outcoupling can be further improved. Besides approaching internal quantum efficiency values of one, we have also focused on reducing energetic and ohmic losses that occur during electron-photon conversion. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point for further research, leading to white OLEDs having efficiencies beyond 100 lm W(-1). This could make white-light OLEDs, with their soft area light and high colour-rendering qualities, the light sources of choice for the future.},

The OLEDs contained the thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitting dopant (4s,6s)-2,4,5,6-tetra(9H-carbazol-9-yl)isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN). OLED degradation proceeds mainly on the basis of excited-state instability of host molecules rather than processes related to 4CzIPN. Additionally, the electrochemical instability of radical cations and anions influences long-term OLED degradation. The formation of exciton quenchers and nonradiative carrier recombination centers acts to reduce OLED luminance. These findings highlight the need for new host material development to fabricate more stable TADF-OLEDs.},

In the neat film a red-shifted phosphorescent excimer emission is observed. In diluted solid solution (polystyrene and dicarbazole-biphenyl films) as well as in de-aerated liquid solutions (tetrahydrofuran, toluene, chloroform) high phosphorescence quantum yields are obtained. In air-saturated liquid solutions, the phosphorescence efficiency is reduced by oxygen quenching.

abstract = {Excited-state absorption spectra have been determined for the lowest excited state of three complexes of Ir(II1) which contain combinations of 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) and the ortho-metalating ligands 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) and benzo[h]quinoline. The two complexes containing bpy, Ir(ppy),(bpy)+ and Ir(bzq),(bpy)+, have similar excited-state absorption spectra which consist of three bands in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions. These three bands are characteristic of bipyridine radical anions and indicate a MLCT excited state in which a metal electron has been promoted to a A* orbital of bpy. The excited-state absorption of Ir(ppy), also displays three bands in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions. However, these bands are less clearly resolved and have somewhat lower extinction coefficients than do the excited-state absorption bands of the complexes which contain bpy. The position of the ultraviolet excited-state absorption band of Ir(ppy), is at 370 nm whereas this band appears at 390 nm in Ir(ppy)2(bpy)+ and in Ir(bzq),(bpy)+. This band position is useful in distinguishing charge transfer to the bpy ligand from charge transfer to ppy.},

@article{Wehrmeister2015,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for a comprehensive analysis of the efficiency roll-off with current density in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By combining electrical and optical excitation in time-resolved spectroscopic experiments, we are able to measure the excited-state lifetime for different driving conditions. It is, thus, possible to correlate changes of the triplet lifetime with a decrease of the radiative quantum efficiency of the emitting system due to exciton quenching processes. As compared to the conventional analysis of the measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) in dependence of the applied current density, the lifetime analysis is not affected by changes of the charge-carrier balance with current, which can have a significant impact on the interpretation of the results. By performing time-resolved spectroscopy for a series of red phosphorescent OLEDs, triplet-polaron quenching (TPQ) is identified as the dominant mechanism behind the efficiency roll-off up to a current density of 100 mA/cm2, while the conventional EQE vs current plot rather suggests triplet-triplet annihilation as the main quenching mechanism. We show that this apparent discrepancy is caused by exciton quenching occurring already at very low current densities, where EQE measurements are not reliable due to significant changes of the charge-carrier balance in this region. In addition, we present evidence that the triplet-polaron quenching rate $\Gamma$TPQ is independent of the microcavity so that variations of the triplet lifetimes of a series of devices exhibiting different layer thicknesses can be described with a single parameter set.},

abstract = {The combination of both very high brightness and deep blue emission from phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLED) is required for both display and lighting applications, yet so far has not been reported. A source of this difficulty is the absence of electron/exciton blocking layers (EBL) that are compatible with the high triplet energy of the deep blue dopant and the high frontier orbital energies of hosts needed to transport charge. Here, we show that N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Ir(III) complexes can serve as both deep blue emitters and efficient hole-conducting EBLs. The NHC EBLs enable very high brightness ({\textgreater}7,800 cd m(-2)) operation, while achieving deep blue emission with colour coordinates of [0.16, 0.09], suitable for most demanding display applications. We find that both the facial and the meridional isomers of the dopant have high efficiencies that arise from the unusual properties of the NHC ligand-that is, the complexes possess a strong metal-ligand bond that destabilizes the non-radiative metal-centred ligand-field states. Our results represent an advance in blue-emitting PHOLED architectures and materials combinations that meet the requirements of many critical illumination applications.},

In this Progress Report, using examples in both small molecule and polymer OLEDs, the different degradation mechanisms in two types of devices are examined. Some of the extrinsic and intrinsic degradation mechanisms in OLEDs are reviewed, and recent work on degradation studies of both small-molecule and polymer OLEDs is presented. For small-molecule OLEDs, the operational degradation of exemplary fluorescent devices is dominated by chemical transformations in the vicinity of the recombination zone. The accumulation of degradation products results in coupled phenomena of luminance-efficiency loss and operating-voltage rise. For polymer OLEDs, it is shown how the charge-transport and injection properties affect the device lifetime. Further, it is shown how the charge balance is controlled by interlayers at the anode contact, and their effects on the device lifetime are discussed.},

abstract = {The main process responsible for the luminance degradation in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) driven under constant current has not yet been identified. In this paper, we propose an approach to describe the intrinsic mechanisms involved in the OLED aging. We first show that a stretched exponential decay can be used to fit almost all the luminance versus time curves obtained under different driving conditions. In this way, we are able to prove that they can all be described by employing a single free parameter model. By using an approach based on local relaxation events, we will demonstrate that a single mechanism is responsible for the dominant aging process. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that the main relaxation event is the annihilation of one emissive center. We then use our model to fit all the experimental data measured under different driving condition, and show that by carefully fitting the accelerated luminance lifetime-curves, we can extrapolate the low-luminance lifetime needed for real display applications, with a high degree of accuracy.},

It is then shown that the energy of this state is not greatly different from the p states of anthracene and naphthalene, and therefore that the ion-pair exciton and Frenkel exciton states can mix. For the cases of anthracene and naphthalene, such configuration interaction leads to the following contributions to the Davydov splitting of the triplet manifold...  In making the computations, it is necessary to consider carefully the effects of vibronic coupling and of configuration changes in the excited state. It is concluded that charge-transfer excitons can make an important contribution to the Davydov splitting of a triplet manifold. This conclusion is supported by preliminary estimates of the interaction matrix elements for crystalline benzene.},

abstract = {This work focuses on the effect of light exposure on ITO/organic interface in organic optoelectronic devices, including organic light emitting devices (OLEDs), organic photo-detectors (OPDs) and organic solar cells (OSCs). The results show that irradiation by light in the visible and UV range leads to a gradual deterioration in charge injection and extraction across the interface. A correlation between the performance stability of the devices and the photo-stability of the ITO/organic contacts is established. Studies also show that this photo-induced degradation can be significantly reduced by means of ITO surface treatment or through the insertion of interfacial layers between ITO and the organic layers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements reveal detectable changes in the interface characteristics after irradiation, indicating that the photo-degradation of the ITO/organic contacts is chemical in nature. Changes in XPS characteristics after irradiation suggest a possible reduction in bonds between ITO and its adjacent organic layer. The results shed light on a new material degradation mechanism that appears to have a wide presence in ITO/organic contacts in general, and which may play a key role in limiting the stability of various organic optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs, OSCs and OPDs. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Two different PhOLEDs, one with a single host, 4,4′-Bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl, and the other with an exciplex-forming co-host, are studied. Trap-assisted recombination with a large number of trapped charges is dominant in the PhOLED with the single host because of the large energy gap between the host and the dopant state. In contrast, bimolecular Langevin recombination is dominant in the PhOLED with the exciplex forming co-host, where a phosphorescent dye is doped in the co-host. As a result, the accumulated charge density is lower in the co-host system than in the single host emission layer, leading to high efficiency that approaches the theoretical limit, with an extremely low efficiency roll-off.},

abstract = {We studied the triplet-polaron quenching in a platinum(II) porphyrin- (PtOEP-) doped polyspirobifluorene (PSF-TAD) copolymer. The copolymer contains a hole-transporting phenylenediamine unit (TAD) as a comonomer. Triplet-polaron quenching was probed by the change in PtOEP phosphorescence lifetime under an applied voltage in a unipolar device. The charge-induced reduction of the optically excited lifetime of PtOEP is one-third for the highest applied bias. The charge density can be obtained from current-voltage characteristics in the space-charge-limited (SCL) regime. The obtained hole mobility under SCL conditions is (7 +/- 2) x 10(-5) cm(2)/(V s). This result is in accord with recent mobility measurements of the time-of-flight mobility in our polymer. The triplet-polaron recombination constant was evaluated to be (4 +/- 1) x 10(-13) cm(3)/s, implying a triplet-polaron interaction radius of 2 x 10(-10) m. The results show that triplet-polaron annihilation cannot be neglected in device models for phosphorescent light-emitting diodes.},

abstract = {The performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is determined by a complex interplay of the optoelectronic processes in the active layer stack. In order to enable simulation-assisted layer stack development, a three-dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo OLED simulation method which includes the charge transport and all excitonic processes is developed. In this paper, the results are presented of simulations including degradation processes in idealized but realizable phosphorescent OLEDs. Degradation is treated as a result of the conversion of emitter molecules to non-emissive sites upon a triplet-polaron quenching (TPQ) process. Under the assumptions made, TPQ provides the dominant contribution to the roll-off. There is therefore a strong relationship between the roll-off and the lifetime. This is quantified using a “uniform density model”, within which the charge carrier and exciton densities are assumed to be uniform across the emissive layer. The simulations give rise to design rules regarding the energy levels, and are used to study the sensitivity of the roll-off and lifetime to various other materials parameters, including the mobility, the phosphorescent dye concentration, the triplet exciton emissive lifetime and binding energy, and the type of TPQ process.},

Investigations show that the quantum yields of both host and emitter in the emission layer degrade due to exciton–polaron interactions and that the deterioration in material quantum yield plays the primary role in device degradation under operation. On the other hand, the results show that the charge balance factor is also affected by exciton–polaron interactions but only plays a secondary role in determining device stability. Finally, we show that the degradation mechanisms in blue PHOLEDs are fundamentally the same as those in green PHOLEDs. The limited stability of the blue devices is a result of faster deterioration in the quantum yield of the emitter.},

In order to provide a control parameter for higher device performance, a stepwise doping concentration profile at the emission layer was prepared. A more than 30{\%} improvement of power efficiency was obtained for green electrophosphorescent device with a higher doping ratio at the emission layer-hole transport layer interface. We explained the carrier trapping and transport mechanism with direct recombination of an exciton in an iridium-based dopant system. When compared to green device, phosphorescent red devices showed a more significant charge trapping effect at low doping concentration, which is responsible for shifting the recombination zone far from the emission layer-hole transport layer interface. Therefore, charge trapping by doping control in an emission layer could be utilized for a charge-balancing technique for the confinement of a triplet exciton.},

The device exhibits peak external quantum and power efficiencies of (12.0 ± 0.6){\%} and (45 ± 2) lm/W, respectively, corresponding to ∼60{\%} internal quantum efficiency. A luminance of 1850 cd/m2 is observed at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The device operating properties are controlled by electron injection into, and transport by the CBP layer along with hole injection from m-MTDATA directly into the Ir(ppy)3 highest occupied molecular level, leading to direct carrier recombination and exciton formation on the phosphor dopant. Ambipolar conduction properties of the Ir(ppy)3:CBP layer are established by analysis of triplet-triplet annihilation, exciton formation and the luminance-current-voltage characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Using single layers devices, the optical response and the half-lifetime behavior of the materials are investigated. Layers of FIr6 exposed to UV-light show the formation of a red emitting degradation product. We analyze the chemical reactions of the materials using laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Several products related to the chemical dissociation of the FIr6 molecule as well as charge complex formation between the emitter and the emitter dissociation products are detected. FIr6 and FIrpic are also compared by lifetime studies on commonly used OLED structures. We show that single layers and OLEDs based on FIrpic exhibit higher stability than those based on FIr6. An explanation for this behavior can be found by considering the chemical structure of the molecules. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Baldo2000,
abstract = {To obtain the maximum luminous efficiency from an organic material, it is necessary to harness both the spin-symmetric and anti-symmetric molecular excitations (bound electron-hole pairs, or excitons) that result from electrical pumping. This is possible if the material is phosphorescent, and high efficiencies have been observed in phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices. However, phosphorescence in organic molecules is rare at room temperature. The alternative radiative process of fluorescence is more common, but it is approximately 75{\%} less efficient, due to the requirement of spin-symmetry conservation. Here, we demonstrate that this deficiency can be overcome by using a phosphorescent sensitizer to excite a fluorescent dye. The mechanism for energetic coupling between phosphorescent and fluorescent molecular species is a long-range, non-radiative energy transfer: the internal efficiency of fluorescence can be as high as 100{\%}. As an example, we use this approach to nearly quadruple the efficiency of a fluorescent red organic light-emitting device.},

abstract = {This work demonstrates an approach for measuring the F{\"{o}}rster radius of energy transfer between electron donating and accepting materials commonly used in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). While energy transfer processes are surprisingly common in OPVs, they are often incorrectly ignored in measurements of the exciton diffusion length and in models of device performance. Here, the efficiency of energy transfer between an emissive donor and an absorptive acceptor is investigated through complementary experimental and theoretical techniques. This is accomplished by spatially separating the donor and acceptor materials using a wide-energy-gap spacer layer to suppress direct charge transfer and tracking donor photoluminescence as a function of spacer layer thickness. Fitting experimental data obtained for a variety of donor materials allows for the extraction of F{\"{o}}rster radii that are in good agreement with predicted values. The impact of donor–acceptor excitonic energy transfer on device performance and on measurements of the exciton diffusion length is also investigated using the archetypical small molecule donor material boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc). An average exciton diffusion length of 7.7 nm is extracted from photoluminescence quenching experiments using SubPc. This value is independent of the quenching material when the role of energy transfer is properly modeled.},

abstract = {The degradation mechanisms of phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PhOLEDs) are studied. The results show that PhOLED degradation is closely linked to interactions between excitons and positive polarons in the host material of the emitter layer (EML), which lead to its aggregation near the EML/electron transport layer (ETL) interface. This exciton-polaron-induced aggregation (EPIA) is associated with the emergence of new emission bands at longer wavelengths in the electroluminescence spectra of these materials, which can be detected after prolonged device operation. Such EPIA processes are found to occur in a variety of wide-bandgap materials commonly used as hosts in PhOLEDs and are correlated with device degradation. Quite notably, the extent of EPIA appears to correlate with the material's bandgap rather than with the glass-transition temperature. The findings uncover a new degradation mechanism, caused by polaron-exciton interactions, that appears to be behind the lower stability of OLEDs utilizing wide-bandgap materials in general. The same degradation mechanism can be expected to be present in other organic optoelectronic devices. Exciton-polaron-induced aggregation occurs in a variety of wide-bandgap materials commonly used as host materials in phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PhOLEDs). Such an aggregation process is determined to play a major role in limiting the electroluminescence stability of PhOLEDs. The extent of aggregation correlates with the material's bandgap rather than with the glass-transition temperature. {\textcopyright} 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract = {Based on the observed changes in chemical compositions of fluorescent and phospho- rescent carbazole-based OLEDs during operation, a free-radical mechanism of operational degrada- tion is proposed. Chemical analysis and identification of low molecular weight and oligomeric products, device physics, photochemistry, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies point to the excited-state homolytic-bond dissociation followed by radical additions as key mechanism steps. Comparable bond dissociation energy and singlet excited-state energy result in a relatively fast degradation process of carbazole-based OLEDs. OLED operation leads to the accumulation of solid- matrix-trapped long-lived $\pi$-radical species in their charged or neutral forms, acting as non-radiative recombination centers and luminescence quenchers. The proposed free-radicals-mediated degrada- tion mechanism could be a common degradation mechanism affecting a wide range of OLED com- positions and structures. In the framework of this mechanism, the relationship between the excited-state energy and theweakest bond dissociation energy ofOLEDmaterials is of the fundamental importance for the operational stability of OLED devices.},

abstract = {We report that the representative arylamine hole transport materials undergo chemical transformations in operating organic light-emitting diode ?OLED? devices. Although the underlying chemical mechanisms are too complex to be completely elucidated, structures of several identified degradation products point at dissociations of relatively weak carbon-nitrogen and carbon-carbon bonds in arylamine molecules as the initiating step. Considering the photochemical reactivities, the bond dissociation reactions of arylamines occur by the homolysis of the lowest singlet excited states formed by recombining charge carriers in the operating OLED device. The subsequent chemical reactions are likely to yield long-lived, stabilized free radicals capable of acting as deep traps— nonradiative recombination centers and fluorescence quenchers. Their presence in the hole transport layer results in irreversible hole trapping and manifests as a positive fixed charge. The extent and localization of chemical transformations in several exemplary devices suggest that the free radical reactions of hole transporting materials, arylamines, can be sufficient to account for the observed luminance efficiency loss and voltage rise in operating OLEDs. The relative bond strengths and excited state energies of OLED materials appear to have a determining effect on the operational stability of OLED devices.},

However, stable operation of OFETs in aqueous media is particularly challenging because of electrolytic hydrolysis of water, high ionic conduction through the analyte, and irreversible damage of organic semiconductors when exposed to water. To date, OFET sensors have shown the capability of label-free sensing of various chemical/biological species, but they could only be used once because their operational stability and lifetime while operating in aqueous environments has been poor, and their response times typically slow. Here, we report on OFETs with unprecedented water stability. These OFETs are suitable for the implementation of reusable chemical/biological sensors because they primarily respond to charged species diluted in an aqueous media by rapidly shifting their threshold voltage. These OFET sensors present stable current baselines and saturated signals which are ideal for detection of low concentration of small or large molecules that alter the pH of an aqueous environment. The overall response of these OFET sensors paves the way for the development of continuous chemical/biological nondestructive sensor applications in aqueous media.},

abstract = {Gaseous HCl generated from a variety of sources is ubiquitous in both outdoor and indoor air. Oxides of nitrogen (NO(y)) are also globally distributed, because NO formed in combustion processes is oxidized to NO(2), HNO(3), N(2)O(5) and a variety of other nitrogen oxides during transport. Deposition of HCl and NO(y) onto surfaces is commonly regarded as providing permanent removal mechanisms. However, we show here a new surface-mediated coupling of nitrogen oxide and halogen activation cycles in which uptake of gaseous NO(2) or N(2)O(5) on solid substrates generates adsorbed intermediates that react with HCl to generate gaseous nitrosyl chloride (ClNO) and nitryl chloride (ClNO(2)), respectively. These are potentially harmful gases that photolyze to form highly reactive chlorine atoms. The reactions are shown both experimentally and theoretically to be enhanced by water, a surprising result given the availability of competing hydrolysis reaction pathways. Airshed modeling incorporating HCl generated from sea salt shows that in coastal urban regions, this heterogeneous chemistry increases surface-level ozone, a criteria air pollutant, greenhouse gas and source of atmospheric oxidants. In addition, it may contribute to recently measured high levels of ClNO(2) in the polluted coastal marine boundary layer. This work also suggests the potential for chlorine atom chemistry to occur indoors where significant concentrations of oxides of nitrogen and HCl coexist.},

abstract = {The hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (HDDA) cascade enables the synthesis of complex benzenoid products with various substitution patterns through aryne intermediates. The first stage of this cascade involves the generation of a highly reactive ortho-benzyne intermediate by a net [4+2] cycloisomerization of a triyne substrate. The benzyne can be rapidly 'trapped' either intramolecularly or intermolecularly with myriad nucleophilic or $\pi$-bond-donating reactants. As a representative example of a general procedure for synthesizing highly substituted benzenoids, this protocol describes the synthesis of a typical triyne substrate and its use as the reactant in an HDDA cascade to form a phthalide. The synthetic procedure detailed herein (four chemical reactions) takes 16-20 h of active effort over a period of several days for the preparation of the triyne precursor and ∼2 h of active effort over a 3-d period for the generation and trapping of the benzyne and isolation of the phthalide product.},

abstract = {Studies of degradation mechanisms in small molecule-based organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) are reviewed. A special emphasis is given to OLEDs based on tris (8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (AlQ(3)), an emitter and electron transport material used in the majority of OLEDs emitting from the green to the red part of the spectrum. Different strategies used for increasing device stability are addressed and the models proposed to explain experimental observations related to OLED operational stability are discussed. Although none of the presently proposed models can explain all experimental observations, the largest body of experimental evidence appears to be consistent with a model based on the instability of cationic AlQ(3) species, produced by the injection of holes into the AlQ(3) electron transport and emitter layer. Other models may be of importance in explaining degradation behavior on different time scales. Models based on redistribution of space charge appear to be responsible for reversible short-term degradation, while a model based on indium migration may be important for degradation on very long time scales.},

@article{Wang2013,
abstract = {We study the stability of common hole transport material/electron transport material (HTM/ETM) interfaces present in typical organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) under various stress scenarios. We determined that these interfaces degrade rapidly, because of an interaction between HTM positive polarons and HTM singlet excitons. The phenomenon results in a deterioration in conduction across the interface, and contributes to the commonly observed increase in OLED driving voltage with electrical driving time. This interfacial degradation can be slowed if the exciton lifetime becomes shorter. The findings uncover a new degradation mechanism that is interfacial in nature, which affects organic/organic interfaces in OLEDs and contributes to their limited electroluminescence stability, and shed light on approaches for reducing it. Although this study has focused on OLEDs, we can expect the same degradation mechanism to affect organic/organic interfaces in other organic optoelectronic devices where both excitons and polarons are present in high concentrations, such as in organic solar cells or photodetectors.},

abstract = {Excitons in polycrystalline and disordered films of organic semiconductors have been shown to diffuse over distances of 10-50 nm. Here, using polarization- and wavelength-dependent photoconductivity in the highly ordered organic semiconductor rubrene, we show that the diffusion of triplet excitons in this material occurs over macroscopic distances (2-8 $\mu$m), comparable to the light absorption length. Dissociation of these excitons at the surface of the crystal is found to be the main source of photoconductivity in rubrene. In addition, we observe strong photoluminescence quenching and a simultaneous enhancement of photoconductivity when the crystal surface is functionalized with exciton splitters. In combination with time-resolved measurements, these observations strongly suggest that long-lived triplet excitons are indeed generated in molecular crystals by fission of singlets, and these triplets provide a significant contribution to the surface photocurrent generated in organic materials. Our findings indicate that the exciton diffusion bottleneck is not an intrinsic limitation of organic semiconductors.},

abstract = {By incorporating two phosphorescent dyes, namely, iridium(III)[bis(4,6-difluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2prime]picolinate (FIrpic) for blue emission and bis(2-(9,9-diethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-1-phenyl-1H-benzoimidazol-N,C3)iridium(acetylacetonate) ((fbi)2Ir(acac)) for orange emission, into a single-energy well-like emissive layer, an extremely high-efficiency white organic light-emitting diode (WOLED) with excellent color stability is demonstrated. This device can achieve a peak forward-viewing power efficiency of 42.5�lm�W-1, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 19.3{\%} and a current efficiency of 52.8�cd�A-1. Systematic studies of the dopants, host and dopant-doped host films in terms of photophysical properties (including absorption, photoluminescence, and excitation spectra), transient photoluminescence, current density-voltage characteristics, and temperature-dependent electroluminescence spectra are subsequently performed, from which it is concluded that the emission natures of FIrpic and (fbi)2Ir(acac) are, respectively, host-guest energy transfer and a direct exciton formation process. These two parallel pathways serve to channel the overall excitons to both dopants, greatly reducing unfavorable energy losses. It is noteworthy that the introduction of the multifunctional orange dopant (fbi)2Ir(acac) (serving as either hole-trapping site or electron-transporting channel) is essential to this concept as it can make an improved charge balance and broaden the recombination zone. Based on this unique working model, detailed studies of the slight color-shift in this WOLED are performed. It is quantitatively proven that the competition between hole trapping on orange-dopant sites and undisturbed hole transport across the emissive layer is the actual reason. Furthermore, a calculation of the fraction of trapped holes on (fbi)2Ir(acac) sites with voltage shows that the hole-trapping effect of the orange dopant is decreased with increasing drive voltage, leading to a reduction of orange emission.},

abstract = {Organic light-emitting devices and solar cells are devices that create, manipulate, and convert excited states in organic semiconductors. It is crucial to characterize these excited states, or excitons, to optimize device performance in applications like displays and solar energy harvesting. This is complicated if the excited state is a triplet because the electronic transition is 'dark' with a vanishing oscillator strength. As a consequence, triplet state spectroscopy must usually be performed at cryogenic temperatures to reduce competition from non-radiative rates. Here, we control non-radiative rates by engineering a solid-state host matrix containing the target molecule, allowing the observation of phosphorescence at room temperature and alleviating constraints of cryogenic experiments. We test these techniques on a wide range of materials with functionalities spanning multi-exciton generation (singlet exciton fission), organic light emitting device host materials, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence type emitters. Control of non-radiative modes in the matrix surrounding a target molecule may also have broader applications in light-emitting and photovoltaic devices.},

We investigate the influence of singlet versus triplet excitons in the EPIA of host materials and the degradation of PhOLEDs. The results show that there is a correlation between device electroluminescence degradation and the concentration of singlet excitons on the host during electrical driving. In contrast, we find no particular correlation between device degradation rate and the concentration of triplet excitons. The results therefore reveal that singlet excitons play the leading role causing the EPIA of host materials and device degradation by this mechanism.},

Most importantly, application of our approach to a model system for poly-(paraphenylenevinylene) shows that the ratio between the electroluminescence and photoluminescence quantum yields generally exceeds the 25{\%} spin-degeneracy statistical limit.},

Trends in optical absorption and emission parameters, molecular structures as defined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, as well as electrochemical redox processes are described. The morphologies and microstructures of the vapor-deposited films grown over a range of growth temperatures have also been characterized. Field-effect transistor (FET) measurements demonstrate that all of these materials are FET-active and, depending on the molecular architecture, exhibit comparably good p- or n-type mobility when optimum film microstructural order is achieved. A very large n-channel mobility of approximately 0.5 cm2/Vs with I(on)/I(off) ratios {\textgreater} 10(8) is achieved for films of 4.},

In view of the important roles of organic components in the stability and lifetime of OLEDs, we initiated an investigation of the operational degradation of CBP in OLEDs in an effort to elucidate the degradation mechanism. Our experimental approach to this task is by performing photochemistry on CBP in solution, thereby avoiding actual operation of CBP-based OLEDs. Prior to the experiments, we calculated the C-N homolytic bond dissociation energy in CBP, and synthesized two CBP derivatives based on molecular engineering considerations. Furthermore, we performed TiO2 photocatalytic decomposition of arylamines as a feasibility test for another operational degradation pathway. Based on both the photochemical and photocatalytic experiments, multiple operational degradation pathways of arylamines emerge.},

The donor-acceptor interface confines the electron and hole in their respective layers, leading to charge separation with a probability that is significantly higher than predicted by bulk theory. The model explains the surprisingly high carrier collection efficiencies observed in organic donor-acceptor photovoltaic cells, and correctly predicts the voltage-dependence of the photocurrent which differs substantially from that of conventional inorganic semiconductor p-n junctions and may ultimately limit the power conversion efficiency of organic donor-acceptor photovoltaic cells. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Previous studies have identified triplet-triplet annihilation and triplet-polaron quenching as the exciton density-dependent mechanisms which give rise to the efficiency roll-off observed in phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). In this work, these quenching processes are independently probed, and the impact of the exciton recombination zone width on the severity of quenching in various OLED architectures is examined directly. It is found that in devices employing a graded-emissive layer (G-EML) architecture the efficiency roll-off is due to both triplet-triplet annihilation and triplet-polaron quenching, while in devices which employ a conventional double-emissive layer (D-EML) architecture, the roll-off is dominated by triplet-triplet annihilation. Overall, the efficiency roll-off in G-EML devices is found to be much less severe than in the D-EML device. This result is well accounted for by the larger exciton recombination zone measured in G-EML devices, which serves to reduce exciton density-driven loss pathways at high excitation levels. Indeed, a predictive model of the device efficiency based on the quantitatively measured quenching parameters shows the role a large exciton recombination zone plays in mitigating the roll-off.},

@article{McAllister2015,
abstract = {Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small-angle neutron scattering recently have revealed that the well-known thermoreversible gelation of methylcellulose (MC) in water is due to the formation of fibrils, with a diameter of 15 ± 2 nm. Here we report that both the linear and nonlinear viscoelastic response of MC solutions and gels can be described by a filament-based mechanical model. In particular, large-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments show that aqueous MC materials transition from shear thinning to shear thickening behavior at the gelation temperature. The critical stress at which MC gels depart from the linear viscoelastic regime and begin to stiffen is well predicted from the filament model over a concentration range of 0.18–2.0 wt {\%}. These predictions are based on fibril densities and persistence lengths obtained experimentally from neutron scattering, combined with cross-link spacings inferred from the gel modulus via the same model. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small-angle neutron scattering recently have revealed that the well-known thermoreversible gelation of methylcellulose (MC) in water is due to the formation of fibrils, with a diameter of 15 ± 2 nm. Here we report that both the linear and nonlinear viscoelastic response of MC solutions and gels can be described by a filament-based mechanical model. In particular, large-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments show that aqueous MC materials transition from shear thinning to shear thickening behavior at the gelation temperature. The critical stress at which MC gels depart from the linear viscoelastic regime and begin to stiffen is well predicted from the filament model over a concentration range of 0.18–2.0 wt {\%}. These predictions are based on fibril densities and persistence lengths obtained experimentally from neutron scattering, combined with cross-link spacings inferred from the gel modulus via the same model.},

The PAL consisted of poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C60butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor. Completely flexible devices (encapsulated between two flexible barrier films) were able to maintain {\textgreater}95{\%} of their initial device performance after 1000 h of aging under damp heat condition (85 °C/85{\%} relative humidity) according to standard IEC 61646. Suns-VOCmeasurements reveal that there is a slight increase in both the transport resistance of the photoactive layer as well as the series resistance of the PEDOT:PSS electrode. Devices encapsulated between two glass plates were able to retain more than 90{\%} of their initial device performance after ca. 1800 h of aging under damp heat condition. Similar devices encapsulated between two glass plates and between a glass plate and flexible barrier film showed almost no degradation after ca. 10,000 h under thermal stress of 85°C (dark and ambient air). Further, remarkable stability of more than 12,000 h with less than 10{\%} reduction in the device performance was achieved under continuous illumination of 1000 W/m2(similar to AM1.5G spectrum but with lower UV content). {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Studies on archetypical PhOLEDs with phosphorescent material, fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium (Ir(ppy)3), show that the lifetime of triplet exciton is modified when in close proximity to a metal layer. Interactions with a metal layer ∼30–100 nm away, as is typically the case in PhOLEDs, result in an increase in the spontaneous emission decay rate of triplet excitons, and causes the exciton lifetime to become shorter as the distance between the phosphorescent material and the metal becomes smaller. The phenomenon, possibly the result of the confined radiation field by the metal, affects device efficiency and efficiency roll-off behavior. The results shed the light on phenomena affecting the efficiency behavior of PhOLEDs, and provide new insights for device design that can help enhance efficiency performance.},

However, the efficiencies of blue TADF OLEDs are still low at high luminance, limiting full-colour display. Here, we report a blue OLED containing a 9,10-dihydroacridine/diphenylsulphone derivative that has a comparable performance to today's best phosphorescent OLEDs. The device offers an external quantum efficiency of 19.5{\%} and reduced efficiency roll-off characteristics at high luminance. Through computational simulation, we identified six pretwisted intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) molecules with small singlet-triplet CT state splitting but different energy relationships between 3CT and locally excited triplet (3LE) states. Systematic comparison of their excited-state dynamics revealed that CT molecules with a large twist angle can emit efficient and short-lifetime (a few microseconds) TADF when the emission peak energy is high enough and the 3LE state is higher than the 3CT state.},

abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are attractive for display applications because of their high brightness, low driving voltage, and tunable color. Their operating lifetimes, hundreds or thousands of hours, are sufficient for only a limited range of applications. The luminance efficiency decreases gradually as the device is operated (electrically aged), for reasons that are poorly understood. A prototypical OLED has the structure anode$\backslash$HTL$\backslash$ETL$\backslash$cathode, where the HTL and ETL are hole- and electron-transporting layers, and the recombination and emission occur at or near the HTL$\backslash$ETL interface. We find that the decreasing luminance efficiency is linearly correlated with an accumulation of immobile positive charge at the HTL$\backslash$ETL interface, and the magnitude of the charge is comparable to the total charge at that interface when an unaged device is operated. A natural explanation of the connection between the two phenomena is that electrical aging either generates hole traps (and trapped holes) or drives metal ions into the device, and that either species act as nonradiative recombination centers. To estimate the accumulating immobile charge and determine its location, we use a variant of a recently introduced capacitance versus voltage technique. In the prototypical OLEDs described here, the HTL is a ca. 1000 Angstrom layer of NPB, and the ETL is a 300-1800 Angstrom layer of Alq(3). A device with an additional "emission layer" (EML) of an anthracene derivative between the HTL and ETL, in which the electroluminescence spectrum is characteristic of the EML, behaved similarly. We surmise that the phenomena reported here may be common to a wider variety of OLED structures and compositions. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Lead chalcogenide nanostructures are good potential candidates for applications in multiexciton solar cells, infrared photodetectors, and electroluminescence devices. Here we report the synthesis and electrical measurements of hyperbranched PbSe nanowire networks. Hyperbranched PbSe nanowire networks are synthesized via a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. The branching is induced by continuously feeding the PbSe reactant with the vapor of a low-melting-point metal catalyst including In, Ga, and Bi. The branches show very regular orientation relationships: either perpendicular or parallel to each other. The diameter of the individual NWs depends on the size of the catalyst droplets, which can be controlled by the catalyst vapor pressure. Significantly, the hyperbranched networks can be grown epitaxially on NaCl, a low-cost substrate for future device array applications. Electrical measurements across branched NWs show the evolution of charge carrier transport with distance and degree of branching.},

abstract = {The complexes [Cu(I)(POP)(dmbpy)][BF4] (1) and [Cu(I)(POP)(tmbpy)][BF4] (2) (dmbpy = 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridyl; tmbpy = 4,4',6,6'-tetramethyl-2,2'-bipyridyl; POP = bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)-phenyl]ether) have been studied in a wide temperature range by steady-state and time-resolved emission spectroscopy in fluid solution, frozen solution, and as solid powders. Emission quantum yields of up to 74{\%} were observed for 2 in a rigid matrix (powder), substantially higher than for 1 of around 9{\%} under the same conditions. Importantly, it was found that the emission of 2 at ambient temperature represents a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) which renders the compound to be a good candidate for singlet harvesting in OLEDs. The role of steric constraints within the complexes, in particular their influences on the emission quantum yields, were investigated by hybrid-DFT calculations for the excited triplet state of 1 and 2 while manipulating the torsion angle between the bipyridyl and POP ligands. Both complexes showed similar flexibility within a ±10° range of the torsion angle; however, 2 appeared limited to this range, whereas 1 could be further twisted with little energy demand. It is concluded that a restricted flexibility leads to a reduction of nonradiative deactivation and thus an increase of emission quantum yield.},

abstract = {The influence of the host molecules on the photoluminescent (PL) and electroluminescent (EL) properties of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) emitters showing efficient thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has yet to be investigated in detail. Here we demonstrate that the choice of host can cause large variations in the PL quantum yield ($\Phi$PL ∼15-70{\%}) and delayed PL transient decay ($\tau$del ∼2-70 ms) of a spiro-acridine-based TADF guest. We show that the effect of exciplex formation on $\Phi$PL must be considered even at low concentrations of the TADF guest. Using the same TADF guest but changing the host layer, we are able to greatly vary the PL transient decay time from ∼4 to ∼70 ms while maintaining a high $\Phi$PL ∼70{\%}, which can lead to new applications. Detailed spectral characterization during PL decay reveals a gradually increasing singlet-triplet energy gap ($\Delta$EST) as the origin of these observations. The time-varying $\Delta$EST is explained based on dipole interactions between the host and guest molecules. Finally, PL and electrical considerations for host selection are discussed based on the performance of OLED devices. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Light-emitting devices with polymeric emissive layers have great promise for the production of large-area, lightweight, flexible color displays, but short lifetimes currently limit applications. We address mechanisms of bulk polymer degradation in these devices and show through in situ Fourier transform infrared characterization of working light-emitting devices with active layers of poly[2- methoxy,5-(2'-ethyl-hexoxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] that oxygen is responsible for the degradation of the polymer film, A mechanism is given based on the formation of singlet oxygen from oxygen impurities in the film via energy transfer from a nonradiative exciton. Fourier transform infrared and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results are consistent with the mechanism, involving singlet oxygen attack followed by free radical processes. We further show that oxygen readily diffuses into the active polymer layer, changing the electrical characteristics of the film even at low concentrations. Thus, polyphenylene-vinylene-based light-emitting devices will self- destruct during operation if fabricated without special attention to eliminating oxygen contamination during fabrication and device operation.

abstract = {Dichloro-bridged dimers of the type [M(L),CI],, where L is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) or benzo[h]quinoline (bzq) and M is Rh(II1) or Ir(III), have been characterized by "C and 'H NMR spectroscopies and by absorption and emission spectroscopies. The NMR results confirm previous formulations of the complexes as dichloro-bridged ortho-metalated dimers in halocarbon solvents but indicate that they are cleaved to monomeric species of the type M(L),CIS in ligating solvents such as dimethylformamide (S = solvent). The absorption spectra of each of the complexes contain several low-energy bands which are assigned as metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) transitions. All four of the dimers emit light following photoexcitation of their glassy solutions at 77 K. Their emission spectra and lifetimes lead to assignments of their emitting states as intraligand (a--{\~{}}*) for the Rh(II1) dimers and MLCT (d--T*) for the Ir(II1) dimers. The Ir(II1) dimers are also found to emit light following excitation at 295 K in deaerated dichloromethane. No emission is seen from the Rh(II1) dimers under these conditions. Comparison of these results with previous results from studies of similar Rh(II1) and Ir(II1) complexes of 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) and 1 ,lo-phenanthroline (phen) indicates that the ortho-metalated ligands are considerably higher than bpy and phen in the spectrochemical series. In addition to raising the energy of ligand field excited states in their complexes, relative to similar bpy and phen species, they induce lower energy charge-transfer transitions. These effects are consistent with the synergistic function of the ortho-metalated ligands as both strong u donors and a acceptors},

In this paper, we report a set of analytical equations which describe how and where defects form during exciton-driven degradation of an OLED and their impact on device operation. This set of equations allows us to quantify changes in the exciton and defect populations as a function of time in neat layers of 4,4 0 -Bis(carbazol-9-yl)bi-phenyl (CBP) in simple bilayer OLEDs. CBP produces luminescent defects which present a unique opportunity to quantify the exciton capturing dynamics of the defects. Through modeling of the time and current density dependence of both the CBP and defect emission, we clearly identify CBP singlet excitons as the source of OLED degradation. Further analysis of experimental data on devices with pre-cisely positioned exciton capturing layers suggests that defects are formed near organic heterojunctions.},

abstract = {The inherent flexibility afforded by molecular design has accelerated the development of a wide variety of organic semiconductors over the past two decades. In particular, great advances have been made in the development of materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), from early devices based on fluorescent molecules to those using phosphorescent molecules. In OLEDs, electrically injected charge carriers recombine to form singlet and triplet excitons in a 1:3 ratio; the use of phosphorescent metal-organic complexes exploits the normally non-radiative triplet excitons and so enhances the overall electroluminescence efficiency. Here we report a class of metal-free organic electroluminescent molecules in which the energy gap between the singlet and triplet excited states is minimized by design, thereby promoting highly efficient spin up-conversion from non-radiative triplet states to radiative singlet states while maintaining high radiative decay rates, of more than 10(6) decays per second. In other words, these molecules harness both singlet and triplet excitons for light emission through fluorescence decay channels, leading to an intrinsic fluorescence efficiency in excess of 90 per cent and a very high external electroluminescence efficiency, of more than 19 per cent, which is comparable to that achieved in high-efficiency phosphorescence-based OLEDs.},

abstract = {Photoinduced and transient absorption spectroscopy is used to study triplet exciton dynamics in thin films of a new thiophene-based oligomer (DCV3T) and blends of DCV3T and fullerene C60. We find enhanced DCV3T triplet exciton generation in the blend layer, which is explained as an excitonic ping-pong effect: singlet energy transfer from DCV3T to C60, followed by immediate intersystem crossing to C60, and triplet exciton back-transfer. Estimations of the rate constants involved show that the ping-pong effect has an overall efficiency close to unity. The singlet-singlet energy transfer from DCV3T to C60 is demonstrated by efficient quenching of DCV3T luminescence in the blend, leading to sensitized emission of C60. We discuss a promising new concept of solar cells with an enlarged active-layer thickness based on potentially long-ranged triplet exciton diffusion in combination with efficient intersystem crossing.},

abstract = {White organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are highly efficient large-area light sources that may play an important role in solving the global energy crisis, while also opening novel design possibilities in general lighting applications. Usually, highly efficient white OLEDs are designed by combining three phosphorescent emitters for the colors blue, green, and red. However, this procedure is not ideal as it is difficult to find sufficiently stable blue phosphorescent emitters. Here, a novel approach to meet the demanding power efficiency and device stability requirements is discussed: a triplet harvesting concept for hybrid white OLED, which combines a blue fluorophor with red and green phosphors and is capable of reaching an internal quantum efficiency of 100{\%} if a suitable blue emitter with high-lying triplet transition is used is introduced. Additionally, this concept paves the way towards an extremely simple white OLED design, using only a single emitter layer.},

The DCM2 PL peaks at 2.20 eV (lambda=563 nm) for pure PS films and shifts to 2.05 eV (lambda=605 nm) for films with 24.5{\%} CA (by mass). The capacitively measured electronic permittivity also increases from epsilon=2.4 to epsilon=5.6 with CA concentration. These results are consistent with the theory of solvatochromism developed for organic molecules in liquid solvents. To our knowledge, this work is the first application of a quantitative theory of solvation to organic molecules in amorphous thin films with continuously controllable permittivity, and demonstrates that "solid state solvation" can be used to predictably tune exciton energies in organic thin film structures.},

In Zr50Cu35Al15, the poorer glass former, the crystal-like structure is more stable under annealing below the glass transition temperature, Tg, than in Zr50Cu45Al5. Variable resolution fluctuation microscopy of the MRO clusters show that in Zr50Cu35Al15 on sub-Tg annealing, the crystal-like clusters shrink even as they grow more ordered, while icosahedral-like clusters grow. Overall, the results suggest that achieving better glass forming ability in this alloy system may depend more on destabilizing crystal-like structures than enhancing non-crystalline structures.},

An OLED that has a unipolar single-host EML with conventional poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) showed high operating voltage, low LE (?26.6 cd/A, 13.7 lm/W), and short lifetime (?4.4 h @ 1000 cd/m2). However, the combined use of a gradient mixed-host EML and a molecularly controlled HIL that has increased surface work function (WF) remarkably decreased operating voltage and improved LE (?68.7 cd/A, 77.0 lm/W) and lifetime (?70.7 h @ 1000 cd/m2). Accumulated charges at the injecting interfaces and formation of a narrow recombination zone close to the interfaces are the major factors that accelerate degradation of charge injection/transport and electroluminescent properties of OLEDs, so achievement of simple-structured OLEDs with high efficiency and long lifetime requires facilitating charge injection and balanced transport into the EML and distributing charge carriers and excitons in EML.},

abstract = {The efficiency of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) made from organic semiconductors is determined by the fraction of injected electrons and holes that recombine to form emissive spin-singlet states rather than non-emissive spin-triplet states. If the process by which these states form is spin-independent, the maximum efficiency of organic LEDs will be limited to 25 per cent. But recent reports have indicated fractions of emissive singlet states ranging from 22 to 63 per cent, and the reason for this variation remains unclear. Here we determine the absolute fraction of singlet states generated in a platinum-containing conjugated polymer and its corresponding monomer. The spin-orbit coupling introduced by the platinum atom allows triplet-state emission, so optically and electrically generated luminescence from both singlet and triplet states can be compared directly. We find an average singlet generation fraction of 22 +/- 1 per cent for the monomer, but 57 +/- 4 per cent for the polymer. This suggests that recombination is spin-independent for the monomer, but that a spin-dependent process, favouring singlet formation, is effective in the polymer. We suggest that this process is a consequence of the exchange interaction, which will operate on overlapping electron and hole wavefunctions on the same polymer chain at their capture radius.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that large-area organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) exhibit slow dynamic response due to their capacitor-like behaviors. In particular, the discharge dynamics of large-area OLEDs is observed to be relatively slower, compared with the charge dynamics. To find ways to increase the response speed of large-area OLEDs, we make an in-depth study of transient electroluminescence (EL) of OLEDs in response to voltage pulses (i.e., pulse separation), device configurations (i.e., device length), and various material parameters (e.g., carrier mobility, exciton lifetime, and energy level offset). The EL response speed can be increased by applying high bias voltage and reducing the device length. Meanwhile, the pulse separation affects the response speed of the second pulse. As the pulse separation is decreased, the ratio of the delay time of the second pulse to the delay time of the first pulse is found to be reduced, whereas the ratio of the peak luminance of the second pulse to the peak one of the first pulse is getting increased. We have also shown that the dependence of the delay time on the carrier mobility, exciton lifetime, and energy level offset is less pronounced. This study may provide design guidelines of OLEDs for practical applications including ac-driven displays and next-generation visible-light communications (VLCs).},

The major use of MSCs at present is in nonsemiconducting applications such as pigments and dyes. One reason for choosing these particular compounds from the many known perylene diimides and phthalocyanines is that they form highly photoactive polycrystalline phases in which much of the oscillator strength resides in a low energy charge transfer absorption band. The intermolecular forces between MSC molecules in a solid are highly directional and spatially complex. Many planar aromatic MSCs form cofacial $\pi$-stacks in which the degree of in-phase electronic overlap between adjacent molecules determines the strength of the intermolecular electronic coupling. The bandwidths of some MSCs vary substantially as the molecules in the crystal lattice shift just slightly relative to their neighbors, causing the wave functions of the adjacent molecules to move in and out of phase with each other.},

The eigenstates of these systems are microcavity polaritons, whose properties are an admixture of the uncoupled exciton and photon. Organic microcavities are particularly interesting due to their large exciton binding energy which permits the electrical excitation of polaritons at room temperature. Measurements of electroluminescence are often facilitated through the use of metallic reflectors that form the optical microcavity and also serve as device electrodes. Here, we demonstrate that such structures exhibit a significant polarization splitting under both optical and electrical excitation. The size of the polarization splitting rivals those observed in strongly coupled microcavities based on distributed Bragg reflectors having a long optical penetration depth.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 the Owner Societies. The temperature effect on the photophysical parameters of four acetylene-derivatives [bis(phenylethynyl)-anthracenes and -fluorenes with substituents of different electron acceptor efficiencies] has been investigated by absorption and emission spectroscopy, using stationary and pulsed (ns/fs resolution) techniques. The nature of the central nucleus (anthracene or fluorene) and the peripheral electron-withdrawing group (nitro or formyl) strongly affect the deactivation of the excited states of these push-pull molecules. In some cases the study evidenced an interesting role of two activated steps in the deactivation of the excited singlet state, namely an activated inter-system crossing to an upper triplet state of n,$\pi$∗ nature (previously hypothesized on the basis of TD-DFT calculations) and a sort of activated internal conversion, discussed also on the basis of maximum entropy method analysis of the fluorescence decay data. Nicely, an efficient ISC was found for the fluorene-derivatives where small energy gaps between S 1  ($\pi$,$\pi$∗) and T n  (n,$\pi$∗) states had been calculated while no activated ISC was evidenced in the case of anthryl-derivatives where higher S 1 -T n  energy gaps are expected. A peculiar temperature effect for a fluorene-derivative was pointed out and also explained on the basis of quantum-mechanical calculations at the DFT level taking into account the solvation effects by means of the conductor-like polarizable continuum model CPCM. The presence of dual emission, at first evidenced by a shoulder in the emission spectrum of the fluorene-derivative featuring a peripheral formyl group in dichloromethane at low temperatures, was nicely confirmed by femtosecond up-conversion measurements at room temperature.},

Based on the results of photoluminescence experiments, they intermit the EML with thin neat layers of TCTA acting as an exciton blocking layer inside the EML which suppresses triplet-triplet annihilation. They show that this EML structure leads to an improved roll-off behavior: Starting at the initial external quantum efficiencies (IEQE) of 15.8{\%} and 14.4{\%} at low brightness for the reference and interlayer device, respectively, those structures yield critical current densities j(c) of 140 mA/cm(2) and 270 mA/cm(2) defining the current density of half-value IEQE.(c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Flexible organic light emitting diode (OLED) will be the ultimate display technology to customers and industries in the near future but the challenges are still being unveiled one by one. Thin-film encapsulation (TFE) technology is the most demanding requirement to prevent water and oxygen permeation into flexible OLED devices. As a polymer substrate does not offer the same barrier performance as glass, the TFE should be developed on both the bottom and top side of the device layers for sufficient lifetimes. This work provides a review of promising thin-film barrier technologies as well as the basic gas diffusion background. Topics include the significance of the device structure, permeation rate measurement, proposed permeation mechanism, and thin-film deposition technologies (Vitex system and atomic layer deposition (ALD)/molecular layer deposition (MLD)) for effective barrier films.},

abstract = {We demonstrate high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes by incorporating a double-emission layer (D-EML) into p ‐ i ‐ n -type cell architecture. The D-EML is comprised of two layers with ambipolar transport characteristics, both doped with the green phosphorescent dye tris(phenylpyridine)iridium. The D-EML system of two bipolar layers leads to an expansion of the exciton generation region. Due to its self-balancing character, accumulation of charge carriers at the outer interfaces is avoided. Thus, a power efficiency of approximately 77 lm∕W and an external quantum efficiency of 19.3{\%} are achieved at 100 cd ∕ m 2 with an operating voltage of only 2.65 V. More importantly, the efficiency decays only weakly with increasing brightness, and a power efficiency of 50 lm∕W is still obtained even at 4000 cd ∕ m 2 .},

We utilized a polymerization-induced microphase separation (PIMS) strategy to prepare nanostructured materials comprising continuous conducting nanochannels intertwined with a mechanically and thermally robust cross-linked polymeric framework. Addition of succinonitrile (SN) rendered the poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium (Li) salt conducting domains completely amorphous, resulting in outstanding conductivities (∼0.35 mS/cm) at 30 °C. Concurrently, a densely cross-linked polystyrene framework provided mechanical robustness (modulus E′ ≈ 0.3 GPa at 30 °C) to the hybrid material. This work highlights a facile, single-pot strategy involving a homogeneous liquid reaction precursor that yields a high-performance ion-conducting membrane attractive for lithium-battery applications.},

abstract = {We examine electron transport in the archetype amorphous organic material tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3). It is established that for Al, LiF/Al, and Mg:Ag cathodes, injection processes at the metal/organic contact dominate the current-voltage characteristics. We find that transport is also injection-limited at low temperatures, but that the cathode dependence of current-voltage characteristics at T=30 K is substantially reduced, raising doubts over metal-to-organic injection models that depend on the cathode work function. Given that ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show a shift in the vacuum potential at the metal/Alq3 interface of ∼1 eV, we investigate the impact of interfacial dipoles on adjacent molecules in the organic film. Consequently, we propose that injection is limited by charge hopping out of interfacial molecular sites whose energy distribution is broadened by local disorder in the interfacial dipole field. We derive a general analytic model of injection from interfacial states and find that it accurately predicts the current-voltage characteristics of transport in Alq3 over many orders of magnitude in current and over a wide range of temperatures. The model is extended to other amorphous organic semiconductors and is found to be applicable to both polymers and small molecular weight organic compounds.},

abstract = {This article describes the first systematic investigation of how the efficiency roll-off in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is influenced by the position and orientation of the emitter molecules within the OLED cavity. The efficiency roll-off is investigated for two OLED stacks containing either the phosphorescent emitter Ir(MDQ)2(acac) or Ir(ppy)3 by varying the distance between emitter and metal cathode; a strong influence of emitter position and orientation on roll-off is observed. The measurements are modeled by triplet-triplet-annihilation (TTA) theory yielding the critical current density and the TTA rate constant. It is found that Ir(MDQ)2(acac) shows the lowest roll-off when the emitter is located in the first optical maximum of the electromagnetic field, whereas the roll-off of the Ir(ppy)3 stack is lowest when the emitter is positioned closer to the metal cathode. Measurement and modeling of time-resolved electroluminescence show that the different roll-off behavior is due to the different orientation and the corresponding change of the decay rate of the emissive dipoles of Ir(MDQ)2(acac) and Ir(ppy)3. Finally, design principles are developed for optimal high-brightness performance by modeling the roll-off as a function of emitter-cathode distance, emissive dipole orientation, and radiative efficiency.},

The scattering and recombination processes between a triplet exciton and a polaron are investigated using a nonadiabatic evolution method based on an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model including interchain interactions. The results show that an excited polaron state can be formed, besides a triplet exciton is converted into a singlet exciton by the polaron. Moreover, the yields of both the singlet exciton and the excited polaron states increase with increasing interchain coupling strength. The excited polaron is luminescent due to radiative decay as is the singlet exciton. Therefore, our results indicate that the quantum efficiency of polymer LEDs could be enhanced by polaron-exciton recombination.},

abstract = {The performance of graded, mixed-layer organic LEDs (OLEDs) is described. The devices are step graded from a mostly hole transporting layer (HTL) to a mostly electron transporting layer (ETL) from anode side to cathode side, respectively. Luminous efficiencies of {\textgreater}4.5 lm/W and 10 cd/A are obtained at 1000 cd/m2 for green, electrofluorescent, graded mixed OLEDs. These efficiencies are significantly higher than those of a uniformly mixed device, i.e., a device in which the HTL and ETL are uniformly mixed, but lower than those of a conventional heterostructure device employing the same dopant material. The operating lifetime of the graded mixed OLEDs is much improved over the heterostructure device. The graded mixed OLED device structure represents a path to achieving extended lifetimes with sufficient efficiency for flat panel display applications in which this parameter is critical to market acceptance.},

abstract = {We present a spectroscopic investigation on the effect of changing the position where carbazole is attached to biphenyl in carbazolebiphenyl (CBP) on the triplet state energies and the propensity to excimer formation. For this, two CBP derivatives have been prepared with the carbazole moieties attached at the (para) 4- and 4(')-positions (pCBP) and at the (meta) 3- and 3(')-positions (mCBP) of the biphenyls. These compounds are compared to analogous mCDBP and pCDBP, i.e. two highly twisted carbazoledimethylbiphenyls, which have a high triplet energy at about 3.0 eV and tend to form triplet excimers in a neat film. This torsion in the structure is associated with localization of the excited state onto the carbazole moieties. We find that in mCBP and pCBP, excimer formation is prevented by localization of the triplet excited state onto the central moiety. As conjugation can continue from the central biphenyls into the nitrogen of the carbazole in the para-connected pCBP, emission involves mainly the benzidine. By contrast, the meta-linkage in mCBP limits conjugation to the central biphenyl. The associated shorter conjugation length is the reason for the higher triplet energy of 2.8 eV in mCBP compared with the 2.65 eV in pCBP.},

abstract = {The main process responsible for the luminance degradation in organic light-emitting diodes OLEDs driven under constant current has not yet been identified. In this paper, we propose an approach to describe the intrinsic mechanisms involved in the OLED aging. We first show that a stretched exponential decay can be used to fit almost all the luminance versus time curves obtained under different driving conditions. In this way, we are able to prove that they can all be described by employing a single free parameter model. By using an approach based on local relaxation events, we will demonstrate that a single mechanism is responsible for the dominant aging process. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that the main relaxation event is the annihilation of one emissive center. We then use our model to fit all the experimental data measured under different driving condition, and show that by carefully fitting the accelerated luminance lifetime-curves, we can extrapolate the low-luminance lifetime needed for real display applications, with a high degree of accuracy},

We employed the technique of optically detected magnetic resonance to measure the spin-dependent exciton formation rates in films of a polymer and corresponding monomer, and explore the relation between the formation rates and the actual singlet-to-triplet ratio measured previously in OLEDs. We found that the spin-dependent exciton formation rates can indeed quantitatively explain the observed exciton yields, and that singlet formation rates and yields are significantly enhanced only in polymer OLEDs, but not in OLEDs made from the corresponding monomer.},

In ambient atmosphere non-encapsulated devices show a lifetime of about 70h in pulsed operation at an initial luminance of 500 cd/m2, almost four times longer than in dc operation. A fast initial decay of luminance is observed for dc operation. It is most probably due to a combination of Joule heating and mobile ionic impurities migration within the OLED structure under the continuous forward electric field. We study also the transient electroluminescence (EL) and report the observation of a short duration spike in the leading edge of the EL response. Its origin is attributed to the temporal shift of the recombination zone in the AlQ layer from the bulk to the interface with TPD subsequent the application of a voltage step. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The overall results of the spectroscopic analysis suggest that strong degradation was accompanied by an eruption underneath the cathode layer. It is posited that the hot gases from the erupted area separated the cathode layer from the organic layer, forming a large bubble, and that, as the bubble exploded, the pressure of the gas blew away the cathode layer.

LDI-TOF-MS has the potential to analyze fully processed organic devices without special pretreatment such as dissolving the device, peeling off, the metal, cathode, or using additional matrix materials. Thus, devices may be analysed as they are with a minimum of measurement artefacts. It is demonstrated that the method allows an analysis of complex organic multilayer devices, their composition, and incorporated impurities. It even allows possible electrochemical reaction products caused by device degradation to be analyzed. Thus, LDI-TOF-MS has major advantages compared to measurements of dissolved samples. As an example, the identification of all of the materials used in a complete OLED is shown Furthermore, a detailed chemical analysis of long-term driven OLEDs, including the detection of degradation products, is presented. From these data, several degradation mechanisms can be distinguished.},

abstract = {We develop a model that predicts two threshold pump intensities in optically pumped organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs); one for pulsed lasing, IPS, and another for continuous-wave (CW) lasing, ICW. The theory predicts a decrease in ICW from 32 kW/cm2, or well above the damage threshold, to 2.2 kW/cm2, for a laser employing 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-julolidyl-9-enyl-4H-pyran–doped tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum if the triplets can be effectively removed from the emissive guest. Based on this analysis, we demonstrate that the lasing duration can be extended to nearly 100 µs, ultimately limited by degradation of the lasing medium when a “triplet manager” molecule, 9,10-di(naphtha-2-yl)anthracene, is blended into the gain region of an otherwise conventional distributed feedback OSL. The triplet manager facilitates radiative singlet transfer while suppressing nonradiative triplet transfer to the emitter molecule, thus reducing the triplet-induced losses. Our theory conclusively shows that these lasers have entered the CW lasing regime.},

Luminescence properties of all the complexes at 298 K in toluene are as follows: quantum yields of phosphorescence Phi(p) = 0.08-0.29, emission peaks lambda(max) = 558-652 nm, and emission lifetimes tau = 0.74-4.7 micros. Bathochromic shifts of the Ir(thpy)(3) family [the complexes with 2-(thiophen-2-yl)pyridine derivatives] are observed by introducing appropriate substituents, e.g., methyl, trifluoromethyl, or thiophen-2-yl. However, Phi(p) of the red emissive complexes (lambda(max) {\textgreater} 600 nm) becomes small, caused by a significant decrease of the radiative rate constant, k(r). In contrast, the complexes with the 1-arylisoquinoline ligands are found to have marked red shifts of lambda(max) and very high Phi(p) (0.19-0.26). These complexes are found to possess dominantly (3)MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) excited states and have k(r) values approximately 1 order of magnitude larger than those of the Ir(thpy)(3) family. An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) device that uses Ir(1-phenylisoquinolinato)(3) as a phosphorescent dopant produces very high efficiency (external quantum efficiency eta(ex) = 10.3{\%} and power efficiency 8.0 lm/W at 100 cd/m(2)) and pure-red emission with 1931 CIE (Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage) chromaticity coordinates (x = 0.68, y = 0.32).},

abstract = {We study triplet exciton diffusion in the archetype organic material 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (CBP) commonly used as a conductive host in the emissive zone of organic light emitting devices. Using time-resolved spectral decay ensuing from the diffusion of an initially localized triplet population to a spatially separated phosphor doped region, we model the delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence decays based on non-dispersive triplet transport. Fits to the model yield a diffusion coefficient of D = (1.4 ± 0.3) × 10-8 cm2/s, and a triplet-triplet bimolecular quenching rate constant of KTT = (1.6 ± 0.4) × 10-14 cm3/s. The results are extended by doping a wide energy-gap molecule into CBP that serves to frustrate triplet transport, lowering both the diffusion coefficient and annihilation rate. These results are used to model a recently demonstrated white organic light emitting device that depends on triplet diffusion in CBP to excite spatially separate fluorescent and phosphorescent doped regions of the emissive layer. We determine the extent to which diffusion contributes to light emission in this structure, and predict its performance based on ideal lumophores with unity quantum yield. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We investigated the effects of pulsed current (PC) and direct current (DC) driving modes on the stability of organic light-emitting diodes with and without hole-injection layers (HILs). Two different HIL materials were used: copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and 4,4′,4″-tris(3-methylphenylphenylamino)triphenylamine (m-MDTATA). It was found that the half-lives of devices using PC driving modes were different from those of comparable devices using DC driving modes. For the devices without HILs, with CuPc HILs and with MTDATA HILs, the half-lives of the devices were changed by factors of 1.91, 1.41 and 0.86, respectively, when operated in PC rather than DC driving modes. Our analysis of the electrical characteristics of the corresponding hole-only devices showed that the number of holes injected into devices was greatly reduced by inserting an m-MTDATA layer compared with other designs. The results indicate that different ratios of injected electrons and holes can be obtained in these devices. Moreover, these ratios play a dominant role in the dependence of the stability of the device on the driving mode.},

@article{Lee2013a,
abstract = {Singlet exciton fission, a process that generates two excitons from a single photon, is perhaps the most efficient of the various multiexciton-generation processes studied to date, offering the potential to increase the efficiency of solar devices. But its unique characteristic, splitting a photogenerated singlet exciton into two dark triplet states, means that the empty absorption region between the singlet and triplet excitons must be filled by adding another material that captures low-energy photons. This has required the development of specialized device architectures. In this Account, we review work to develop devices that harness the theoretical benefits of singlet exciton fission. First, we discuss singlet fission in the archetypal material, pentacene. Pentacene-based photovoltaic devices typically show high external and internal quantum efficiencies. They have enabled researchers to characterize fission, including yield and the impact of competing loss processes, within functional devices. We review in situ probes of singlet fission that modulate the photocurrent using a magnetic field. We also summarize studies of the dissociation of triplet excitons into charge at the pentacene-buckyball (C60) donor-acceptor interface. Multiple independent measurements confirm that pentacene triplet excitons can dissociate at the C60 interface despite their relatively low energy. Because triplet excitons produced by singlet fission each have no more than half the energy of the original photoexcitation, they limit the potential open circuit voltage within a solar cell. Thus, if singlet fission is to increase the overall efficiency of a solar cell and not just double the photocurrent at the cost of halving the voltage, it is necessary to also harvest photons in the absorption gap between the singlet and triplet energies of the singlet fission material. We review two device architectures that attempt this using long-wavelength materials: a three-layer structure that uses long- and short-wavelength donors and an acceptor and a simpler, two-layer combination of a singlet-fission donor and a long-wavelength acceptor. An example of the trilayer structure is singlet fission in tetracene with copper phthalocyanine inserted at the C60 interface. The bilayer approach includes pentacene photovoltaic cells with an acceptor of infrared-absorbing lead sulfide or lead selenide nanocrystals. Lead selenide nanocrystals appear to be the most promising acceptors, exhibiting efficient triplet exciton dissociation and high power conversion efficiency. Finally, we review architectures that use singlet fission materials to sensitize other absorbers, thereby effectively converting conventional donor materials to singlet fission dyes. In these devices, photoexcitation occurs in a particular molecule and then energy is transferred to a singlet fission dye where the fission occurs. For example, rubrene inserted between a donor and an acceptor decouples the ability to perform singlet fission from other major photovoltaic properties such as light absorption.},

Homogeneous deformation occurs when 110-oriented face-centered-cubic metal wires are twisted, leading to the nucleation of coaxial dislocations, analogous to the Eshelby twist mechanism. Heterogeneous deformation is predicted for 111 and 100 wires under torsion, localized at the twist boundaries. These simulations also reveal the detailed mechanisms of twist boundary formation from dislocation reactions.},

These instruments have traditionally been constructed with simple tools using natural materials, primarily bamboo and wood. Unlike some Asian traditional instruments, the khaen has not undergone modernization, and high quality instruments are still made in the traditional manner by village craftsmen. In the past bamboo could have been used for the reeds as well as the pipes, but metal reeds have been used extensively for some time. Measurements have been made on reeds and pipes from two khaen: one a high quality instrument made in northeastern Thailand and one an inexpensive khaen purchased at an import shop. Analysis and comparison have been made of the physical properties of the bamboo pipes, the composition of the alloys used for the metal reeds, and the mechanical properties of the reed such as the elastic modulus. Comparisons can be made with an earlier published analysis of the properties...},

The high singlet (∼4.5 eV) and triplet (∼3.5 eV) energies associated with these materials effectively suppress both the electron and energy transfer quenching pathways between the emissive dopant and the host material, leading to deep blue phosphorescent devices with high (∼10{\%}) external quantum efficiencies. Furthermore, by direct charge injection from the adjacent hole and electron transport layers onto the phosphor doped into the UGH matrix, exciton formation occurs directly on the dopant, thereby eliminating exchange energy losses characteristic of guest−host energy transfer. We discuss the material design, and present device data for OLEDs employing UGHs. Among the four host materials, UGH2 and UGH3 have higher quantum efficiencies than UGH1 when used in OLEDs. Rapid device degradation was observed for the UGH4-based device due to electro- and/or photooxidation of the diphenylmethane moiety in UGH4. In addition to showing that UGH materials can be used to fabricate efficient blue OLEDs, we demonstrate that very high device efficiencies can be achieved in structures where the dopant transports both charge and excitons.},

@article{Peumans2003,
abstract = {In this review, we discuss the physics underlying the operation of single and multiple heterojunction, vacuum-deposited organic solar cells based on small molecular weight thin films. For single heterojunctioncells, we find that the need for direct contact between the deposited electrode and the active organics leads to quenching of excitons. An improved device architecture, the double heterojunction, is shown to confine excitons within the active layers, allowing substantially higher internal efficiencies to be achieved. A full optical and electrical analysis of the double heterostructure architecture leads to optimal cell design as a function of the optical properties and exciton diffusion lengths of the photoactive materials. Combining the double heterostructure with novel light trapping schemes, devices with external efficiencies approaching their internal efficiency are obtained. When applied to an organic photovoltaic cell with a power conversion efficiency of 1.0{\%}±0.1{\%} under 1 sun AM1.5 illumination,devices with external power conversion efficiencies of 2.4{\%}±0.3{\%} are reported. In addition, we show that by using materials with extended exciton diffusion lengths L D , highly efficient double heterojunctionphotovoltaic cells are obtained, even in the absence of a light trapping geometry. Using C 60 as an acceptor material, double heterostructure external power conversion efficiencies of 3.6{\%}±0.4{\%} under 1 sun AM1.5 illumination are obtained. Stacking of single heterojunction devices leads to thin film multiple heterojunction photovoltaic and photodetectorstructures. Thin bilayer photovoltaic cells can be stacked with ultrathin (∼5 {\AA}), discontinuous Ag layers between adjacent cells serving as efficient recombination sites for electrons and holes generated in the neighboring cells. Such stacked cells have open circuit voltages that are n times the open circuit voltage of a single cell, where n is the number of cells in the stack. In optimized structures, the short circuit photocurrent remains approximately constant upon stacking thin cells, leading to higher achievable power conversion efficiencies, as confirmed by modelling optical interference effects and exciton migration. A 2.5{\%}±0.3{\%} power efficiency under 100  mW / cm 2 AM1.5 illumination conditions is obtained by stacking two ∼1{\%} efficient devices. Alternatively, when the contact layers between the stacked cells are eliminated, a multilayerstructure consisting of alternating films of donor and acceptor-type materials is obtained. Since the thicknesses of the individual layers (∼5 {\AA}) can be substantially smaller than the exciton diffusion length, nearly 100{\%} of the photogenerated excitons are dissociated, and the resulting free charges are detected. In addition, the ultrathin organic layers facilitate electron and hole transport through the multilayer stack by tunneling. When these devices are operated as photodetectors under applied fields {\textgreater}10 6   V / cm , the carrier collection efficiency reaches 80{\%}, leading to external quantum efficiencies of 75{\%}±1{\%} across the visible spectrum in cells containing the thinnest layers. We find that due to the fast carrier tunneling process, the temporal response of these multilayer detectors is a direct measure of exciton dynamics. Response times of 720±50  ps are achieved, leading to a 3 dB bandwidth of 430±30  MHz . A summary of representative results obtained for both polymer and small molecule photovoltaic cells and photodetectors is included in this review. Prospects for further improvements in organic solar cells and photodetectors are considered.},

abstract = {The transport properties of electrons and holes in poly(dialkoxy‐p‐phenylene vinylene) (PPV) are investigated by current–voltage measurements using Ca as an electron and indium‐tin‐oxide as a hole injecting contact. Both the electron and hole currents are dominated by the bulk conduction properties of the PPV, in contrast to previous reports. The hole current is governed by bulk space‐charge limited conductivity and a hole mobility of 0.5×10-6 cm2/V s is determined. The electron current is strongly reduced by the presence of traps with a total density of 1018 cm-3. {\textcopyright} 1996 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The commercial breakthrough of phosphorescent organic white light sources is presently hampered due to the unavailability of a stable blue phosphorescent emitter material. Moreover, only few analytical investigations have been made regarding the chemical degradation of the phosphorescent emitter materials during the processing or the operation of the devices. Organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) containing phosphorescent metal complexes with iridium as central ion were investigated. Special attention was paid to the chemical degradation of the material. The devices were analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS). Electron spray ionization (ESI) was employed as ionization source. Isomerization phenomena of the blue-green emitting heteroleptic iridium complex FIrpic could be observed after the device manufacture and after operation. These findings could give hints on the mechanisms that influence the lifetime of PhOLEDs based on FIrpic or similar blue emitters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Electroluminescence efficiency roll-off at high current density is dramatically suppressed using ACRXTN as an emitter instead of 2CzPN because of suppressed bimolecular exciton annihilation processes such as singlet-triplet and triplet-triplet annihilation. The rate constant of reverse intersystem crossing from triplet to singlet excited states of ACRXTN is about 300 times higher than that of 2CzPN, decreasing triplet exciton density and suppressing exciton annihilation processes under optical and electrical excitation.},

Significant energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 into the triplet levels of $\alpha$-NPD was observed. In the case of the TPD host, however, partial confinement of the Ir(ppy)3 triplet exciton was observed. This result suggests both forward and backward energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 to the TPD triplet levels. Furthermore, employing TAPC as a hole-transport layer achieved strong confinement of the Ir(ppy)3 triplet exciton. One conclusion from these results is that electrophosphorescence efficiency is well correlated with the triplet energy level of the hole-transport layer host materials},

Using a fullerene acceptor, a poly(3-hexylthiophene) exciton confinement layer, and a conventional optical trapping scheme, we show a peak external quantum efficiency of (109 ± 1){\%} at wavelength $\lambda$ = 670 nanometers for a 15-nanometer-thick pentacene film. The corresponding internal quantum efficiency is (160 ± 10){\%}.

The OLEDs are investigated using the laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The comparison between the collected spectra for electrically aged and unaged OLEDs allows the identification of different reaction products, like fragments which are mainly related to the chemical dissociation of FIrpic molecules during the OLED operation. We present different reaction pathways of the blue emitter FIrpic. One proposed reaction indicates that the short lifetimes of the OLEDs may be related to the irreversible dissociation of the FIrpic molecule by the loss of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the picolinate ligand. Additionally, the formation of chemical complexes between different fragments of the FIrpic molecules with their neighbour materials is visible. The cesium adducts of FIrpic formation indicate a possible contribution of the dopant to the OLED degradation process. Finally, we show rearrangement effects in the Cs doped electron transporting layer. This rearrangement is indicated by the presence of m/z signals of the BPhen dimer and adducts of the dimer with Cs.},

abstract = {The formation dynamics of polaron pairs, polarons, and triplet excitons in regiorandom and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (RRa-P3HT and RR-P3HT) films was comprehensively studied by transient absorption spectroscopy over the wide wavelength region from 500 to 1650 nm under various excitation intensities. In both RRa-P3HT and RR-P3HT films, polaron pairs were generated not from relaxed singlet exciton states but from hot excitons on a time scale of {\textless}100 fs and decayed monomolecularly by geminate recombination. In RRa-P3HT films, triplet excitons were rapidly generated on a picosecond time scale from higher exciton states produced by the singlet exciton-exciton annihilation as well as from the lowest singlet exciton states by the normal intersystem crossing. In RR-P3HT films, no triplet excitons were observed; polarons were also generated not from relaxed singlet exciton states but from hot excitons in competition with the formation of polaron pairs. The polarons formed in RR-P3HT can freely migrate and mainly recombine with other polarons bimolecularly in the nanosecond time domain. The ultrafast formation of triplet excitons can be explained by the singlet exciton fission into two triplets, and the ultrafast formation of polaron pairs and polarons can be explained on the basis of the hot-exciton dissociation model where the excess thermal energy of the initially formed hot excitons is necessary to overcome their Coulombic binding energy. The remarkably different formation dynamics in P3HTs with different regioregularities is discussed in terms of the film morphology of conjugated polymers.},

abstract = {A study has been made of the electronic transitions between the lowest triplet state of anthracene and its ground state. Low‐temperature spectroscopic study of the phosphorescence revealed a sharp emission band with a 0,0‐frequency (T→S) at 14 927 cm—1 (EPA rigid glass solution at 77°K). A vibrational analysis in terms of known Raman frequencies indicates that the transition is of a u→g allowed type. The T←S absorption band was observed in anthracene with the 0,0‐frequency at 14 850 cm—1 (solution at 293°K). The study of the phosphorescence spectra of seven different chlorinated anthracenes confirmed the assignment of the anthracene lowest triplet. This study re‐establishes the earlier value obtained by Lewis and Kasha, and rejects the recent value deduced by Reid. A correlation of the above results for anthracene with calculations and observations on related polyacenes indicates that the lowest triplet of benzene is 3 B 1u (in D 6h ), and for naphthalene, anthracene, and naphthacene the lowest triplet is 3 B 2u (in D 2h ). The perturbing singlets which mix with these triplets are obtained from previously derived rules for spin‐orbital coupling in molecules.},

abstract = {Photoconversion in planar-heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) is limited by a short exciton diffusion length (L(D)) that restricts migration to the dissociating electron donor/acceptor interface. Consequently, bulk heterojunctions are often used to realize high efficiency as these structures reduce the distance an exciton must travel to be dissociated. Here, we present an alternative approach that seeks to directly engineer L(D) by optimizing the intermolecular separation and consequently, the photophysical parameters responsible for excitonic energy transfer. By diluting the electron donor boron subphthalocyanine chloride into a wide-energy-gap host material, we optimize the degree of interaction between donor molecules and observe a {\~{}}50{\%} increase in L(D). Using this approach, we construct planar-heterojunction OPVs with a power conversion efficiency of (4.4 ± 0.3){\%}, {\textgreater} 30{\%} larger than the case of optimized devices containing an undiluted donor layer. The underlying correlation between L(D) and the degree of molecular interaction has wide implications for the design of both OPV active materials and device architectures.},

@article{Sanvitto2016,
abstract = {Polaritons are quasiparticles that form in semiconductors when an elementary excitation such as an exciton or a phonon interacts suuciently strongly with light. In particular, exciton–polaritons have attracted tremendous attention for their unique properties, spanning from an ability to undergo ultra-eecient four-wave mixing to superfluidity in the condensed state. These quasiparticles possess strong intrinsic nonlinearities, while keeping most characteristics of the underlying photons. Here we review the most important features of exciton–polaritons in microcavities, with a particular emphasis on the emerging technological applications, the use of new materials for room-temperature operation, and the possibility of exploiting polaritons for quantum computation and simulation. T he interaction of light with matter is at the heart of nearly all of the optical processes we are familiar with. It gives rise to absorption, spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, while also dictating the refractive index via material polarizability. In all of these cases, it is assumed that the oscillating electromagnetic field does not significantly modify the electronic states of the under-lying atomic structure. Evidently, if either the field or the interaction is strong enough, this approximation can fail. The bare photon and matter components must then mix to create hybrid light/matter states, called polaritons, which possess unique properties derived from these two constituents. For isolated atoms, this regime can be achieved via the use of optical resonators to create discrete photonic states near resonance with an electronic transition. In condensed matter systems, polaritons have been found to occur naturally in certain molecular and semiconductor crystals 1,2 . The true potential of these quasiparticles, however, is unveiled when they are combined with an optical microcavity — typically a planar Fabry–P{\'{e}}rot cavity composed of two highly reflecting mirrors. The resulting coupled states, called microcavity polaritons, possess a non-parabolic dis-persion relation dramatically different from that in bulk materials, as well as a number of additional remarkable properties: a very light effective mass, the possibility to be selectively excited, controlled or detected, and also, perhaps most importantly, a strong nonlinear character. Fascinating effects have been observed in semiconductor microcavities, such as stimulated parametric scattering 3 , polariton condensation 4,5 , long-range spatial coherence 4,6,7 , superfluidity 8,9 , quantized vorticity 10,11 and many others. As our understanding of the phenomenology and materials has matured, a number of in-teresting applications have also emerged: low-threshold lasers and optical switching are the most prevalent, but polaritons have also been exploited to modify chemical reactions and to model corre-lated electronic systems. Here, we will review the most important properties of microcavity polaritons and discuss their potential applications. We will also highlight progress in using materials that allow for room-temperature operation — a necessity for realizing practical devices — and recent efforts to observe genuine quantum effects in polaritonic systems. Although we will restrict our attention to planar microcavities, it is worth mentioning that polaritons have been observed in a wide variety of photonic systems, such as those supporting surface and localized plasmons, Bloch surface waves and Tamm modes 12–14 .

abstract = {The preparation, photophysics, and solid state structures of octahedral organometallic Ir complexes with several different cyclometalated ligands are reported. IrCl3.nH2O cleanly cyclometalates a number of different compounds (i.e., 2-phenylpyridine, 2-(p-tolyl)pyridine, benzoquinoline, 2-phenylbenzothiazole, 2-(1-naphthyl)benzothiazole, and 2-phenylquinoline), forming the corresponding chloride-bridged dimers, CwedgeN2Ir(mu-Cl)2IrCwedgeN2 (CwedgeNis a cyclometalated ligand) in good yield. These chloride-bridged dimers react with acetyl acetone (acacH) and other bidentate, monoanionic ligands such as picolinic acid (picH) and N-methylsalicylimine (salH), to give monomeric CwedgeN2Ir(LX) complexes (LX = acac, pic, sal). The emission spectra of these complexes are largely governed by the nature of the cyclometalating ligand, leading to lambda(max) values from 510 to 606 nm for the complexes reported here. The strong spin-orbit coupling of iridium mixes the formally forbidden 3MLCT and 3pi-pi* transitions with the allowed 1MLCT, leading to a strong phosphorescence with good quantum efficiencies (0.1-0.4) and room temperature lifetimes in the microsecond regime. The emission spectra of the CwedgeN2Ir(LX) complexes are surprisingly similar to the fac-IrCwedgeN3 complex of the same ligand, even though the structures of the two complexes are markedly different. The crystal structures of two of the CwedgeN2Ir(acac) complexes (i.e., CwedgeN = ppy and tpy) have been determined. Both complexes show cis-C,C', trans-N,N' disposition of the two cyclometalated ligands, similar to the structures reported for other complexes with a "CwedgeN2Ir" fragment. NMR data (1H and 13C) support a similar structure for all of the CwedgeN2Ir(LX) complexes. Close intermolecular contacts in both (ppy)2Ir(acac) and (tpy)2Ir(acac) lead to significantly red shifted emission spectra for crystalline samples of the ppy and tpy complexes relative to their solution spectra.},

In both cases, degradation is primarily due to the formation of nonemissive regions, or dark spot defects. By studying the structure and evolution of the dark spots, we infer that the growth of electrode defects limits device lifetime. Hermetic packaging of OLEDs is essential if they are to be used in commercially viable flat panel displays.},

@article{Wohlgenannt2001,
abstract = {Electroluminescence in organic light-emitting diodes arises from a charge-transfer reaction between the injected positive and negative charges by which they combine to form singlet excitons that subsequently decay radiatively. The quantum yield of this process (the number of photons generated per electron or hole injected) is often thought to have a statistical upper limit of 25 per cent. This is based on the assumption that the formation cross-section of singlet excitons, sigmaS, is approximately the same as that of any one of the three equivalent non-radiative triplet exciton states, sigmaT; that is, sigmaS/sigmaT approximately 1. However, recent experimental and theoretical work suggests that sigmaS/sigmaT may be greater than 1. Here we report direct measurements of sigmaS/sigmaT for a large number of pi-conjugated polymers and oligomers. We have found that there exists a strong systematic, but not monotonic, dependence of sigmaS/sigmaT on the optical gap of the organic materials. We present a detailed physical picture of the charge-transfer reaction for correlated pi-electrons, and quantify this process using exact valence bond calculations. The calculated sigmaS/sigmaT reproduces the experimentally observed trend. The calculations also show that the strong dependence of sigmaS/sigmaT on the optical gap is a signature of the discrete excitonic energy spectrum, in which higher energy excitonic levels participate in the charge recombination process.},

Various extraction layers are examined for their effect on device stability, including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and MoO3 for hole extraction layers, as well as LiF, Cs2CO3, and lithium acetylacetonate (Liacac) for electron extraction layers. The organic/metal interface is shown to be inherently photo-unstable, resulting in significant losses in device efficiency with irradiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the organic/aluminum interface suggest that the photo-induced changes are chemical in nature. In general, interfacial layers are shown to substantially reduce photo-degradation of the active layer/electrode interface. In spite of their photo-stability, several interfacial layers present at the active layer/cathode interface suffer from thermal degradation effects due to temperature increases under exposure to light. Electrical aging effects are proven to be negligible in comparison to other major modes of degradation.},

abstract = {Detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of the pulsed excitation of polymer light emitting diodes is presented. We find a set of universal transient features for a variety of device configurations (different polymers/cathodes) which can be reproduced using our phenomenological numerical model. We find that the temporal evolution of the electroluminescence in response to a step voltage pulse is characterized by: (i) a delay followed by; (ii) a fast initial rise at turn-on followed by; (iii) a slow rise (slower by at least one order of magnitude). The large mobility mismatch between holes and electrons in conjugated polymers allows us to separately time resolve the motion of holes and electrons. We suggest a method for extracting mobility values that takes into account the possible field-induced broadening of carrier fronts, and which is found to be compatible with mobilities determined from constant wave measurements. By using appropriate device configurations it is possible to determine the mobilities of both holes and electrons from a single device. Mobilities for holes and electrons are extracted for a poly(p-phenylenevinylene) copolymer and poly(di-octyl fluorene). (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics. [S0021-8979(99)07621-5].},

abstract = {We examine the luminescence from optical microcavities containing an organic semiconductor in the regime of strong exciton-photon coupling. The ratio of luminescence from the upper polariton branch to the lower polariton branch is studied as a function of microcavity detuning and temperature under both optical and electrical excitation. The population of the upper polariton branch is modeled by means of thermal activation from an uncoupled exciton reservoir. Here, the activation energy for the population of the upper polariton branch is equal to the energetic separation between the exciton reservoir and the upper branch at the angle of detection. Agreement is obtained with this model under both optical and electrical excitation using measurements of angle-resolved microcavity reflectivity and luminescence.},

abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are attractive for next-generation displays and lighting applications because of their potential for high electroluminescence (EL) efficiency, flexibility and low-cost manufacture. Although phosphorescent emitters containing rare metals such as iridium or platinum produce devices with high EL efficiency, these metals are expensive and their blue emission remains unreliable for practical applications. Recently, a new route to high EL efficiency using materials that emit through thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was demonstrated. However, it is unclear whether devices that emit through TADF, which originates from the contributions of triplet excitons, are reliable. Here we demonstrate highly efficient, stable OLEDs that emit via TADF by controlling the position of the carrier recombination zone, resulting in projected lifetimes comparable to those of tris(2-phenylpyridinato)iridium(III)-based reference OLEDs. Our results indicate that TADF is intrinsically stable under electrical excitation and optimization of the surrounding materials will enhance device reliability.},

abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted much attention in research and industry thanks to their capability to emit light with high efficiency and to deliver high-quality white light that provides good color rendering. OLEDs feature homogeneous large area emission and can be produced on flexible substrates. In terms of efficiency, OLEDs can compete with highly efficient conventional light sources but their efficiency typically decreases at high brightness levels, an effect known as efficiency roll-off. In recent years, much effort has been undertaken to understand the underlying processes and to develop methods that improve the high-brightness performance of OLEDs. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and provide a detailed description of the relevant principles, both for phosphorescent and fluorescent emitter molecules. In particular, we focus on exciton-quenching mechanisms, such as triplet-triplet annihilation, quenching by polarons, or field-induced quenching, but also discuss mechanisms such as changes in charge carrier balance. We further review methods that may reduce the roll-off and thus enable OLEDs to be used in high-brightness applications.},

abstract = { It has been demonstrated that the efficiency roll-off is generally caused by the accumulation of excitons or charge carriers, which is intimately related to the emissive layer (EML) architecture in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this article, an efficient sandwich-type EML structure with a mixed-host EML sandwiched between two single-host EMLs was designed to eliminate this accumulation, thus simultaneously achieving high efficiency, low efficiency roll-off and good operational stability in the resulting OLEDs. The devices show excellent electroluminescence performances, realizing a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.6$\backslash${\%} with a maximum power efficiency of 105.6 lm W–1 and a maximum current efficiency of 93.5 cd A–1. At the high brightness of 5 000 cd m–2, they still remain as high as 23.3$\backslash${\%}, 71.1 lm W–1, and 88.3 cd A–1, respectively. And, the device lifetime is up to 2000 h at initial luminance of 1000 cd m–2, which is significantly higher than that of compared devices with conventional EML structures. The improvement mechanism is systematically studied by the dependence of the exciton distribution in EML and the exciton quenching processes. It can be seen that the utilization of the efficient sandwich-type EML broadens the recombination zone width, thus greatly reducing the exciton quenching and increasing the probability of the exciton recombination. It is believed that the design concept provides a new avenue for us to achieve high-performance OLEDs. },

abstract = {Arynes (aromatic systems containing, formally, a carbon–carbon triple bond) are among the most versatile of all reactive intermediates in organic chemistry. They can be 'trapped' to give products that are used as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, polymers and other fine chemicals. Here we explore a strategy that unites the de novo generation of benzynes—through a hexadehydro-Diels–Alder reaction—with their in situ elaboration into structurally complex benzenoid products. In the hexadehydro-Diels–Alder reaction, a 1,3-diyne is engaged in a [412] cycloisomerization with a 'diynophile' to produce the highly reactive benzyne intermediate. The reaction conditions for this simple, thermal transformation are notable for being free of metals and reagents. The subsequent and highly efficient trapping reactions increase the power of the overall process. Finally, we provide examples of how this de novo benzyne generation approach allows new modes of intrinsic reactivity to be revealed. ortho-Benzyne (1,2-didehydrobenzene, 1, Fig. 1a) is one of the oldest 1 , most interesting, most useful and most well-studied of all reactive intermediates in chemistry. The multifaceted and often remarkably efficient reactions of benzynes with suitable trapping reagents (1R3 in Fig. 1a) have long been employed in the service of synthetic chemistry. Even by 1967 many such reactions were known 2},

abstract = {Gaseous HCl generated from a variety of sources is ubiquitous in both outdoor and indoor air. Oxides of nitrogen (NO(y)) are also globally distributed, because NO formed in combustion processes is oxidized to NO(2), HNO(3), N(2)O(5) and a variety of other nitrogen oxides during transport. Deposition of HCl and NO(y) onto surfaces is commonly regarded as providing permanent removal mechanisms. However, we show here a new surface-mediated coupling of nitrogen oxide and halogen activation cycles in which uptake of gaseous NO(2) or N(2)O(5) on solid substrates generates adsorbed intermediates that react with HCl to generate gaseous nitrosyl chloride (ClNO) and nitryl chloride (ClNO(2)), respectively. These are potentially harmful gases that photolyze to form highly reactive chlorine atoms. The reactions are shown both experimentally and theoretically to be enhanced by water, a surprising result given the availability of competing hydrolysis reaction pathways. Airshed modeling incorporating HCl generated from sea salt shows that in coastal urban regions, this heterogeneous chemistry increases surface-level ozone, a criteria air pollutant, greenhouse gas and source of atmospheric oxidants. In addition, it may contribute to recently measured high levels of ClNO(2) in the polluted coastal marine boundary layer. This work also suggests the potential for chlorine atom chemistry to occur indoors where significant concentrations of oxides of nitrogen and HCl coexist.},

abstract = {Study of the transient electroluminescence (EL) behavior at turn-on upon the application of a single voltage pulse is presented. Based on the continuity equations which describe the carrier dynamics, and on the recombination current which describe the EL output, we present a theoretical model to explain the slow rise of the EL associated to the electron packet motion in the bulk. The model enables us to determine, more than the mobility of majority carriers, the equilibrium density of free holes in the bulk. The dependence of free hole density (pe) of the applied voltage shows that the unipolar current flow for holes in the bulk follows as expected, an SCLC regime characterized by a linear dependence of pe with applied voltage. Our analysis allows us also to estimate the trap density (for holes) in the bulk of about 2 ?? 1015 cm-3. Both experimental and theoretical results are compared to each other and to other works, and were found to be consistent with the proposed model. The device under investigation is the conventional ITO/MEH-PPV/Al OLED. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Liu2004,
abstract = {The lifetime is one of the main issues in the development of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). In this paper, we present a new OLED with an emitting layer (EML) based on a blue mixed-host (MH) structure. Compared to the conventional host-dopant system, the MH structure consists of two different hosts and one-dopant materials. Using the structure with different host ratio and fixed dopant concentration, the Commission International de L'Eclairage (CIE 1931) coordinates will shift from (0.17, 0.32) to (0.15, 0.22). The operating lifetime of optimal device is much improved over the heterostructure OLEDs, which shows the lifetime of approximately 110 h with initial luminance of 10000 cd/m2. The luminance reaches 80370 cd/m2at 10 V, which corresponds to a luminous efficiency of 1.8 cd/A. The significant improvement in device lifetime is attributed to the elimination of the heterojunction interface and the prevention to the formation of fluorescence quenchers. These results demonstrate that the MH structure can extend lifetime without significantly changing the EML with common host material. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We study the photostability of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). Irradiating OLEDs by external illumination is found to result in a gradual increase in driving voltage and decrease in electroluminescence (EL) efficiency. This photoinduced degradation in device performance is found to be caused by changes at the organic/metal cathode interface that lead to a deterioration in electron injection. Evidence of photodegradation of the same interface, inherently, by device own EL, is also reported. The results uncover an important degradation mechanism in OLEDs and shed the light on a phenomenon that might limit the stability of other organic optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.

@article{Zhu2008,
abstract = {Manipulating the morphology of inorganic nanostructures, such as their chirality and branching structure, has been actively pursued as a means of controlling their electrical, optical and mechanical properties. Notable examples of chiral inorganic nanostructures include carbon nanotubes, gold multishell nanowires, mesoporous nanowires and helical nanowires. Branched nanostructures have also been studied and been shown to have interesting properties for energy harvesting and nanoelectronics. Combining both chiral and branching motifs into nanostructures might provide new materials properties. Here we show a chiral branched PbSe nanowire structure, which is formed by a vapour-liquid-solid branching from a central nanowire with an axial screw dislocation. The chirality is caused by the elastic strain of the axial screw dislocation, which produces a corresponding Eshelby Twist in the nanowires. In addition to opening up new opportunities for tailoring the properties of nanomaterials, these chiral branched nanowires also provide a direct visualization of the Eshelby Twist.},
