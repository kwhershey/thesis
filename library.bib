abstract = {Fundamental device physics of exciton dynamics is crucial to the design and fabrication of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with a long lifetime at high brightness. In this paper, we report a set of analytical equations which describe how and where defects form during exciton-driven degradation of an OLED and their impact on device operation. This set of equations allows us to quantify changes in the exciton and defect populations as a function of time in neat layers of 4,4 0 -Bis(carbazol-9-yl)bi-phenyl (CBP) in simple bilayer OLEDs. CBP produces luminescent defects which present a unique opportunity to quantify the exciton capturing dynamics of the defects. Through modeling of the time and current density dependence of both the CBP and defect emission, we clearly identify CBP singlet excitons as the source of OLED degradation. Further analysis of experimental data on devices with pre-cisely positioned exciton capturing layers suggests that defects are formed near organic heterojunctions.},

@article{Wang2009,
abstract = {By incorporating two phosphorescent dyes, namely, iridium(III)[bis(4,6-difluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2prime]picolinate (FIrpic) for blue emission and bis(2-(9,9-diethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-1-phenyl-1H-benzoimidazol-N,C3)iridium(acetylacetonate) ((fbi)2Ir(acac)) for orange emission, into a single-energy well-like emissive layer, an extremely high-efficiency white organic light-emitting diode (WOLED) with excellent color stability is demonstrated. This device can achieve a peak forward-viewing power efficiency of 42.5�lm�W-1, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 19.3{\%} and a current efficiency of 52.8�cd�A-1. Systematic studies of the dopants, host and dopant-doped host films in terms of photophysical properties (including absorption, photoluminescence, and excitation spectra), transient photoluminescence, current density-voltage characteristics, and temperature-dependent electroluminescence spectra are subsequently performed, from which it is concluded that the emission natures of FIrpic and (fbi)2Ir(acac) are, respectively, host-guest energy transfer and a direct exciton formation process. These two parallel pathways serve to channel the overall excitons to both dopants, greatly reducing unfavorable energy losses. It is noteworthy that the introduction of the multifunctional orange dopant (fbi)2Ir(acac) (serving as either hole-trapping site or electron-transporting channel) is essential to this concept as it can make an improved charge balance and broaden the recombination zone. Based on this unique working model, detailed studies of the slight color-shift in this WOLED are performed. It is quantitatively proven that the competition between hole trapping on orange-dopant sites and undisturbed hole transport across the emissive layer is the actual reason. Furthermore, a calculation of the fraction of trapped holes on (fbi)2Ir(acac) sites with voltage shows that the hole-trapping effect of the orange dopant is decreased with increasing drive voltage, leading to a reduction of orange emission.},

@article{Burrows1994,
abstract = {We present a simple encapsulation technique for organic light emitting devices (OLEDs). By studying the degradation of a population of OLEDs, we show that the lifetime of encapsulated devices is increased by more than two orders of magnitude over that of unencapsulated devices. In both cases, degradation is primarily due to the formation of nonemissive regions, or dark spot defects. By studying the structure and evolution of the dark spots, we infer that the growth of electrode defects limits device lifetime. Hermetic packaging of OLEDs is essential if they are to be used in commercially viable flat panel displays.},

@article{Kondakov2008,
abstract = {We report that the representative arylamine hole transport materials undergo chemical transformations in operating organic light-emitting diode ?OLED? devices. Although the underlying chemical mechanisms are too complex to be completely elucidated, structures of several identified degradation products point at dissociations of relatively weak carbon-nitrogen and carbon-carbon bonds in arylamine molecules as the initiating step. Considering the photochemical reactivities, the bond dissociation reactions of arylamines occur by the homolysis of the lowest singlet excited states formed by recombining charge carriers in the operating OLED device. The subsequent chemical reactions are likely to yield long-lived, stabilized free radicals capable of acting as deep traps— nonradiative recombination centers and fluorescence quenchers. Their presence in the hole transport layer results in irreversible hole trapping and manifests as a positive fixed charge. The extent and localization of chemical transformations in several exemplary devices suggest that the free radical reactions of hole transporting materials, arylamines, can be sufficient to account for the observed luminance efficiency loss and voltage rise in operating OLEDs. The relative bond strengths and excited state energies of OLED materials appear to have a determining effect on the operational stability of OLED devices.},

abstract = {The influence of the host molecules on the photoluminescent (PL) and electroluminescent (EL) properties of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) emitters showing efficient thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has yet to be investigated in detail. Here we demonstrate that the choice of host can cause large variations in the PL quantum yield ($\Phi$PL ∼15-70{\%}) and delayed PL transient decay ($\tau$del ∼2-70 ms) of a spiro-acridine-based TADF guest. We show that the effect of exciplex formation on $\Phi$PL must be considered even at low concentrations of the TADF guest. Using the same TADF guest but changing the host layer, we are able to greatly vary the PL transient decay time from ∼4 to ∼70 ms while maintaining a high $\Phi$PL ∼70{\%}, which can lead to new applications. Detailed spectral characterization during PL decay reveals a gradually increasing singlet-triplet energy gap ($\Delta$EST) as the origin of these observations. The time-varying $\Delta$EST is explained based on dipole interactions between the host and guest molecules. Finally, PL and electrical considerations for host selection are discussed based on the performance of OLED devices. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We report a significant enhancement and a reduced efficiency roll-off in blue and white phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) based on a mixed host structure. The combination of a hole-transport-type host and an electron-transport-type host as a mixed host emissive layer resulted in an effective charge carrier injection and distribution of the recombination zone, and therefore highly efficient blue PHOLEDs with peak external quantum and power efficiencies of 21.6{\%} and 44.9 lm/W were achieved. Moreover, white PHOLEDs with a mixed host structure showed a power efficiency of 37 lm/W, which is over four times higher than 8.7 lm/W in a single host structure device at a luminance of 1000   cd / m 2 .},

All three substates are involved in the emission process at 300 K resulting in an average decay time of 2.1 ??s. Magnetic field application at T=1.5 K alters the dominant radiative deactivation process from a forbidden to a significantly allowed process.

abstract = {A numerical study of space charge effects in multilayerorganic light-emitting diodes(OLEDs) is presented. The method of solving the coupled Poisson and continuity equations, previously established for single-layer polymer LEDs, has been extended to treat internal organic interfaces. In addition, we consider the transient current and electroluminescence response. We discuss the accumulation of charges at internal interfaces and their signature in the transient response as well as the electric field distribution. Comparison to experimental transient data of a typical bilayer LED based on tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum ( Alq 3 ) is provided and good agreement is found. Our results are consistent with commonly assumed operating principles of bilayer LEDs. In particular, the assumptions that the electric field is predominantly dropped across the Alq 3 layer and that the electroluminescence delay time is determined by electrons passing through Alq 3 to the internal interface are self-consistently supported by the results of the simulation. Moreover, the creation of emissive singlet excitons is found to be strongly confined to the Alq 3 side of the internal interface and the emission zone width is dictated by the excitondiffusion length. Design principles for trilayerLEDs with improved power efficiency are also discussed.},

Here, we will briefly review the fundamental mechanisms leading to excitonic energy-driven device ageing in two example devices: blue emitting electrophosphorescent organic light emitting devices (PHOLEDs) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells.

abstract = {We study the stability of common hole transport material/electron transport material (HTM/ETM) interfaces present in typical organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) under various stress scenarios. We determined that these interfaces degrade rapidly, because of an interaction between HTM positive polarons and HTM singlet excitons. The phenomenon results in a deterioration in conduction across the interface, and contributes to the commonly observed increase in OLED driving voltage with electrical driving time. This interfacial degradation can be slowed if the exciton lifetime becomes shorter. The findings uncover a new degradation mechanism that is interfacial in nature, which affects organic/organic interfaces in OLEDs and contributes to their limited electroluminescence stability, and shed light on approaches for reducing it. Although this study has focused on OLEDs, we can expect the same degradation mechanism to affect organic/organic interfaces in other organic optoelectronic devices where both excitons and polarons are present in high concentrations, such as in organic solar cells or photodetectors.},

Both the electron and hole currents are dominated by the bulk conduction properties of the PPV, in contrast to previous reports. The hole current is governed by bulk space‐charge limited conductivity and a hole mobility of 0.5×10-6 cm2/V s is determined.

abstract = {The root causes of the differences in electroluminescence stability among phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PHOLEDs) utilizing different emitter guests are studied. The results show that the host material plays a more influential role in limiting device stability in comparison to the guest. During the operation of a PHOLED, the host undergoes aggregation as a result of interactions between the excitons and positive polarons. The rate of this aggregation is found to be the limiting factor for device lifetime and is influenced by the choice of the guest material and its concentration. Finally, it is shown that phase segregation between the host and the guest is an important aspect of the aggregation process. As a result of this segregation, energy transfer from the host to the guest becomes increasingly less efficient, resulting in the observed gradual loss in electroluminescence efficiency in the devices over time. The findings explain why PHOLEDs utilizing different guest materials but otherwise identical material systems can have significantly different lifetimes and provide an answer to a long-lasting question in the field.},

abstract = {Organic light-emitting devices and solar cells are devices that create, manipulate, and convert excited states in organic semiconductors. It is crucial to characterize these excited states, or excitons, to optimize device performance in applications like displays and solar energy harvesting. This is complicated if the excited state is a triplet because the electronic transition is 'dark' with a vanishing oscillator strength. As a consequence, triplet state spectroscopy must usually be performed at cryogenic temperatures to reduce competition from non-radiative rates. Here, we control non-radiative rates by engineering a solid-state host matrix containing the target molecule, allowing the observation of phosphorescence at room temperature and alleviating constraints of cryogenic experiments. We test these techniques on a wide range of materials with functionalities spanning multi-exciton generation (singlet exciton fission), organic light emitting device host materials, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence type emitters. Control of non-radiative modes in the matrix surrounding a target molecule may also have broader applications in light-emitting and photovoltaic devices.},

This behavior, we find, results primarily from different rates of exicton-polaron-induced aggregation (EPIA) of the host material due to exciton-polaron interactions. We investigate the influence of singlet versus triplet excitons in the EPIA of host materials and the degradation of PhOLEDs. The results show that there is a correlation between device electroluminescence degradation and the concentration of singlet excitons on the host during electrical driving. In contrast, we find no particular correlation between device degradation rate and the concentration of triplet excitons. The results therefore reveal that singlet excitons play the leading role causing the EPIA of host materials and device degradation by this mechanism.},

Significant energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 into the triplet levels of $\alpha$-NPD was observed. In the case of the TPD host, however, partial confinement of the Ir(ppy)3 triplet exciton was observed. This result suggests both forward and backward energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 to the TPD triplet levels. Furthermore, employing TAPC as a hole-transport layer achieved strong confinement of the Ir(ppy)3 triplet exciton. One conclusion from these results is that electrophosphorescence efficiency is well correlated with the triplet energy level of the hole-transport layer host materials},

Two different HIL materials were used: copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and 4,4′,4″-tris(3-methylphenylphenylamino)triphenylamine (m-MDTATA). It was found that the half-lives of devices using PC driving modes were different from those of comparable devices using DC driving modes. For the devices without HILs, with CuPc HILs and with MTDATA HILs, the half-lives of the devices were changed by factors of 1.91, 1.41 and 0.86, respectively, when operated in PC rather than DC driving modes. Our analysis of the electrical characteristics of the corresponding hole-only devices showed that the number of holes injected into devices was greatly reduced by inserting an m-MTDATA layer compared with other designs. The results indicate that different ratios of injected electrons and holes can be obtained in these devices. Moreover, these ratios play a dominant role in the dependence of the stability of the device on the driving mode.},

abstract = {The synthesis and photophysical study of a family of cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes are reported. The iridium complexes have two cyclometalated (CN) ligands and a single monoanionic, bidentate ancillary ligand (LX), i.e., CN2Ir(LX). The CN ligands can be any of a wide variety of organometallic ligands. The LX ligands used for this study were all $\beta$-diketonates, with the major emphasis placed on acetylacetonate (acac) complexes. The majority of the CN2Ir(acac) complexes phosphoresce with high quantum efficiencies (solution quantum yields, 0.1−0.6), and microsecond lifetimes (e.g., 1−14 $\mu$s). The strongly allowed phosphorescence in these complexes is the result of significant spin−orbit coupling of the Ir center. The lowest energy (emissive) excited state in these CN2Ir(acac) complexes is a mixture of 3MLCT and 3($\pi$−$\pi$*) states. By choosing the appropriate CN ligand, CN2Ir(acac) complexes can be prepared which emit in any color from green to red. Simple, systematic changes in the CN ligands, which lead to bathochromic shifts of the free ligands, lead to similar bathochromic shifts in the Ir complexes of the same ligands, consistent with “CN2Ir”-centered emission. Three of the CN2Ir(acac) complexes were used as dopants for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The three Ir complexes, i.e., bis(2-phenylpyridinato-N,C2‘)iridium(acetylacetonate) [ppy2Ir(acac)], bis(2-phenyl benzothiozolato-N,C2‘)iridium(acetylacetonate) [bt2Ir(acac)], and bis(2-(2‘-benzothienyl)pyridinato-N,C3‘)iridium(acetylacetonate) [btp2Ir(acac)], were doped into the emissive region of multilayer, vapor-deposited OLEDs. The ppy2Ir(acac)-, bt2Ir(acac)-, and btp2Ir(acac)-based OLEDs give green, yellow, and red electroluminescence, respectively, with very similar current−voltage characteristics. The OLEDs give high external quantum efficiencies, ranging from 6 to 12.3{\%}, with the ppy2Ir(acac) giving the highest efficiency (12.3{\%}, 38 lm/W, {\textgreater}50 Cd/A). The btp2Ir(acac)-based device gives saturated red emission with a quantum efficiency of 6.5{\%} and a luminance efficiency of 2.2 lm/W. These CN2Ir(acac)-doped OLEDs show some of the highest efficiencies reported for organic light emitting diodes. The high efficiencies result from efficient trapping and radiative relaxation of the singlet and triplet excitons formed in the electroluminescent process.},

abstract = {We present a unified device model for single layer organic light emitting diodes (LEDs) which includes charge injection, transport, and space charge effects in the organic material. The model can describe both injection limited and space charge limited current flow and the transition between them. We specifically considered cases in which the energy barrier to injection of electrons is much larger than that for holes so that holes dominate the current flow in the device. Charge injection into the organic material occurs by thermionic emission and by tunneling. For Schottky energy barriers less than about 0.3-0.4 eV, for typical organic LED device parameters, the current flow is space charge limited and the electric field in the structure is highly nonuniform. For larger energy barriers the current flow is injection limited. In the injection limited regime, the net injected charge is relatively small, the electric field is nearly uniform, and space charge effects are not important. At smaller bias in the injection limited regime, thermionic emission is the dominant injection mechanism. For this case the thermionic emission injection current and a backward flowing interface recombination current, which is the time reversed process of thermionic emission, combine to establish a quasi-equilibrium carrier density. The quasi-equilibrium density is bias dependent because of image force lowering of the injection barrier. The net device current is determined by the drift of these carriers in the nearly constant electric field. The net device current is much smaller than either the thermionic emission or interface recombination current which nearly cancel. At higher bias, injection is dominated by tunneling. The bias at which tunneling exceeds thermionic emission depends on the size of the Schottky energy barrier. When tunneling is the dominant injection mechanism, a combination of tunneling injection current and the backflowing interface recombination current combine to establish the carrier density. We compare the model results with experimental measurements on devices fabricated using the electroluminescent conjugated polymer poly[2-methoxy, 5-(2{\^{a}}€²-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] which by changing the contacts can show either injection limited behavior or space charge limited behavior. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {To obtain the maximum luminous efficiency from an organic material, it is necessary to harness both the spin-symmetric and anti-symmetric molecular excitations (bound electron-hole pairs, or excitons) that result from electrical pumping. This is possible if the material is phosphorescent, and high efficiencies have been observed in phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices. However, phosphorescence in organic molecules is rare at room temperature. The alternative radiative process of fluorescence is more common, but it is approximately 75{\%} less efficient, due to the requirement of spin-symmetry conservation. Here, we demonstrate that this deficiency can be overcome by using a phosphorescent sensitizer to excite a fluorescent dye. The mechanism for energetic coupling between phosphorescent and fluorescent molecular species is a long-range, non-radiative energy transfer: the internal efficiency of fluorescence can be as high as 100{\%}. As an example, we use this approach to nearly quadruple the efficiency of a fluorescent red organic light-emitting device.},

abstract = {Photoconversion in planar-heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) is limited by a short exciton diffusion length (L(D)) that restricts migration to the dissociating electron donor/acceptor interface. Consequently, bulk heterojunctions are often used to realize high efficiency as these structures reduce the distance an exciton must travel to be dissociated. Here, we present an alternative approach that seeks to directly engineer L(D) by optimizing the intermolecular separation and consequently, the photophysical parameters responsible for excitonic energy transfer. By diluting the electron donor boron subphthalocyanine chloride into a wide-energy-gap host material, we optimize the degree of interaction between donor molecules and observe a {\~{}}50{\%} increase in L(D). Using this approach, we construct planar-heterojunction OPVs with a power conversion efficiency of (4.4 ± 0.3){\%}, {\textgreater} 30{\%} larger than the case of optimized devices containing an undiluted donor layer. The underlying correlation between L(D) and the degree of molecular interaction has wide implications for the design of both OPV active materials and device architectures.},

abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are attractive for next-generation displays and lighting applications because of their potential for high electroluminescence (EL) efficiency, flexibility and low-cost manufacture. Although phosphorescent emitters containing rare metals such as iridium or platinum produce devices with high EL efficiency, these metals are expensive and their blue emission remains unreliable for practical applications. Recently, a new route to high EL efficiency using materials that emit through thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was demonstrated. However, it is unclear whether devices that emit through TADF, which originates from the contributions of triplet excitons, are reliable. Here we demonstrate highly efficient, stable OLEDs that emit via TADF by controlling the position of the carrier recombination zone, resulting in projected lifetimes comparable to those of tris(2-phenylpyridinato)iridium(III)-based reference OLEDs. Our results indicate that TADF is intrinsically stable under electrical excitation and optimization of the surrounding materials will enhance device reliability.},

In both RRa-P3HT and RR-P3HT films, polaron pairs were generated not from relaxed singlet exciton states but from hot excitons on a time scale of {\textless}100 fs and decayed monomolecularly by geminate recombination. In RRa-P3HT films, triplet excitons were rapidly generated on a picosecond time scale from higher exciton states produced by the singlet exciton-exciton annihilation as well as from the lowest singlet exciton states by the normal intersystem crossing. In RR-P3HT films, no triplet excitons were observed; polarons were also generated not from relaxed singlet exciton states but from hot excitons in competition with the formation of polaron pairs. The polarons formed in RR-P3HT can freely migrate and mainly recombine with other polarons bimolecularly in the nanosecond time domain. The ultrafast formation of triplet excitons can be explained by the singlet exciton fission into two triplets, and the ultrafast formation of polaron pairs and polarons can be explained on the basis of the hot-exciton dissociation model where the excess thermal energy of the initially formed hot excitons is necessary to overcome their Coulombic binding energy. The remarkably different formation dynamics in P3HTs with different regioregularities is discussed in terms of the film morphology of conjugated polymers.},

Estimations of the rate constants involved show that the ping-pong effect has an overall efficiency close to unity. The singlet-singlet energy transfer from DCV3T to C60 is demonstrated by efficient quenching of DCV3T luminescence in the blend, leading to sensitized emission of C60.

abstract = {Studies on the long-term degradation of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) based on tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (AlQ3), the most widely used electroluminescent molecule, reveal that injection of holes in AlQ3 is the main cause of device degradation. The transport of holes into AlQ3 caused a decrease in its fluorescence quantum efficiency, thus showing that cationic AlQ3 species are unstable and that their degradation products are fluorescence quenchers. These findings explain the success of different approaches to stabilizing OLEDs, such as doping of the hole transport layer, introducing a buffer layer at the hole-injecting contact, and using mixed emitting layers of hole and electron transporting molecules.},

abstract = {Phosphorescence studies of a series of facial homoleptic cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes have been carried out. The complexes studied have the general structure Ir(III)(C-N)(3), where (C-N) is a monoanionic cyclometalating ligand: 2-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)pyridinato, 2-(thiophen-2-yl)-5-trifluoromethylpyridinato, 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyridinato, 2,5-di(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)pyridinato, 2-(benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)pyridinato, 2-(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)pyridinato, 1-phenylisoquinolinato, 1-(thiophen-2-yl)isoquinolinato, or 1-(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)isoquinolinato. Luminescence properties of all the complexes at 298 K in toluene are as follows: quantum yields of phosphorescence Phi(p) = 0.08-0.29, emission peaks lambda(max) = 558-652 nm, and emission lifetimes tau = 0.74-4.7 micros. Bathochromic shifts of the Ir(thpy)(3) family [the complexes with 2-(thiophen-2-yl)pyridine derivatives] are observed by introducing appropriate substituents, e.g., methyl, trifluoromethyl, or thiophen-2-yl. However, Phi(p) of the red emissive complexes (lambda(max) {\textgreater} 600 nm) becomes small, caused by a significant decrease of the radiative rate constant, k(r). In contrast, the complexes with the 1-arylisoquinoline ligands are found to have marked red shifts of lambda(max) and very high Phi(p) (0.19-0.26). These complexes are found to possess dominantly (3)MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) excited states and have k(r) values approximately 1 order of magnitude larger than those of the Ir(thpy)(3) family. An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) device that uses Ir(1-phenylisoquinolinato)(3) as a phosphorescent dopant produces very high efficiency (external quantum efficiency eta(ex) = 10.3{\%} and power efficiency 8.0 lm/W at 100 cd/m(2)) and pure-red emission with 1931 CIE (Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage) chromaticity coordinates (x = 0.68, y = 0.32).},

The donor-acceptor interface confines the electron and hole in their respective layers, leading to charge separation with a probability that is significantly higher than predicted by bulk theory. The model explains the surprisingly high carrier collection efficiencies observed in organic donor-acceptor photovoltaic cells, and correctly predicts the voltage-dependence of the photocurrent which differs substantially from that of conventional inorganic semiconductor p-n junctions and may ultimately limit the power conversion efficiency of organic donor-acceptor photovoltaic cells. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this contribution, it is shown that the method of laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LDI-TOF-MS) is a powerful technique for analyzing complete organic devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) or organic solar cells. LDI-TOF-MS has the potential to analyze fully processed organic devices without special pretreatment such as dissolving the device, peeling off, the metal, cathode, or using additional matrix materials. Thus, devices may be analysed as they are with a minimum of measurement artefacts. It is demonstrated that the method allows an analysis of complex organic multilayer devices, their composition, and incorporated impurities. It even allows possible electrochemical reaction products caused by device degradation to be analyzed. Thus, LDI-TOF-MS has major advantages compared to measurements of dissolved samples. As an example, the identification of all of the materials used in a complete OLED is shown Furthermore, a detailed chemical analysis of long-term driven OLEDs, including the detection of degradation products, is presented. From these data, several degradation mechanisms can be distinguished.},

abstract = {Transient electroluminescence (EL) from polymer light emitting diodes is investigated by measurements of the response to short voltage pulses. The carrier mobility is derived from the delay time between the electrical pulse and the onset of EL, muapproximate to3x10(-4) cm(2)/V s. Bilayer devices with a polyethylene-dioxythiophene (PEDOT), hole injection layer are also studied. The delay time between the electrical pulse and the onset of EL is independent of the thickness of the injection layer, implying that the conducting PEDOT functions as a part of the electrode. When a dc forward bias is applied to the device, the delay time decreases, probably as a result of the shift of the emission zone towards the anode. The EL turn-on depends on the amplitude of the voltage pulse. The data are modeled by an equivalent circuit with a fixed capacitance connected in parallel with a nonlinear resistance. The solution of the differential equation depends on the exact form of the device's I-V curve. Two analytical solutions are provided, and an analysis based on space-charge-limited current is presented. By applying a dc forward bias in advance to precharge the space-charge capacitance, the turn-on response time is reduced to 12 ns. The EL decay consists of two components with time constants of 15 ns and 1 mus. The decay does not depend on either the amplitude of the voltage pulse or the prebias.

Emission quantum yields of up to 74{\%} were observed for 2 in a rigid matrix (powder), substantially higher than for 1 of around 9{\%} under the same conditions. Importantly, it was found that the emission of 2 at ambient temperature represents a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) which renders the compound to be a good candidate for singlet harvesting in OLEDs. The role of steric constraints within the complexes, in particular their influences on the emission quantum yields, were investigated by hybrid-DFT calculations for the excited triplet state of 1 and 2 while manipulating the torsion angle between the bipyridyl and POP ligands. Both complexes showed similar flexibility within a ±10° range of the torsion angle; however, 2 appeared limited to this range, whereas 1 could be further twisted with little energy demand. It is concluded that a restricted flexibility leads to a reduction of nonradiative deactivation and thus an increase of emission quantum yield.},

abstract = {We studied the triplet-polaron quenching in a platinum(II) porphyrin- (PtOEP-) doped polyspirobifluorene (PSF-TAD) copolymer. The copolymer contains a hole-transporting phenylenediamine unit (TAD) as a comonomer. Triplet-polaron quenching was probed by the change in PtOEP phosphorescence lifetime under an applied voltage in a unipolar device. The charge-induced reduction of the optically excited lifetime of PtOEP is one-third for the highest applied bias. The charge density can be obtained from current-voltage characteristics in the space-charge-limited (SCL) regime. The obtained hole mobility under SCL conditions is (7 +/- 2) x 10(-5) cm(2)/(V s). This result is in accord with recent mobility measurements of the time-of-flight mobility in our polymer. The triplet-polaron recombination constant was evaluated to be (4 +/- 1) x 10(-13) cm(3)/s, implying a triplet-polaron interaction radius of 2 x 10(-10) m. The results show that triplet-polaron annihilation cannot be neglected in device models for phosphorescent light-emitting diodes.},

abstract = {The development of white organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) holds great promise for the production of highly efficient large-area light sources. High internal quantum efficiencies for the conversion of electrical energy to light have been realized. Nevertheless, the overall device power efficiencies are still considerably below the 60-70 lumens per watt of fluorescent tubes, which is the current benchmark for novel light sources. Although some reports about highly power-efficient white OLEDs exist, details about structure and the measurement conditions of these structures have not been fully disclosed: the highest power efficiency reported in the scientific literature is 44 lm W(-1) (ref. 7). Here we report an improved OLED structure which reaches fluorescent tube efficiency. By combining a carefully chosen emitter layer with high-refractive-index substrates, and using a periodic outcoupling structure, we achieve a device power efficiency of 90 lm W(-1) at 1,000 candelas per square metre. This efficiency has the potential to be raised to 124 lm W(-1) if the light outcoupling can be further improved. Besides approaching internal quantum efficiency values of one, we have also focused on reducing energetic and ohmic losses that occur during electron-photon conversion. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point for further research, leading to white OLEDs having efficiencies beyond 100 lm W(-1). This could make white-light OLEDs, with their soft area light and high colour-rendering qualities, the light sources of choice for the future.},

abstract = {We demonstrate high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes by incorporating a double-emission layer (D-EML) into p ‐ i ‐ n -type cell architecture. The D-EML is comprised of two layers with ambipolar transport characteristics, both doped with the green phosphorescent dye tris(phenylpyridine)iridium. The D-EML system of two bipolar layers leads to an expansion of the exciton generation region. Due to its self-balancing character, accumulation of charge carriers at the outer interfaces is avoided. Thus, a power efficiency of approximately 77 lm∕W and an external quantum efficiency of 19.3{\%} are achieved at 100 cd ∕ m 2 with an operating voltage of only 2.65 V. More importantly, the efficiency decays only weakly with increasing brightness, and a power efficiency of 50 lm∕W is still obtained even at 4000 cd ∕ m 2 .},

abstract = {Using experimental devices which do not show electroluminescence, we have previously found that photoluminescence of tris8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (AlQ3), a widely used organic electroluminescent material, decreases under prolonged transport of holes. This leads to a conclusion that AlQ3 cations are unstable, and to our proposal that the same mechanism is responsible for degradation of organic light-emitting devices OLEDs based on AlQ3. In this communication, we broaden our studies to include simultaneous electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements on OLEDs containing thin AlQ3 as the emitter layer. Results show that the decrease in the electroluminescence efficiency is indeed associated with degradation of the AlQ3 in the vicinity of the hole transport layer interface.},

The OLEDs are investigated using the laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The comparison between the collected spectra for electrically aged and unaged OLEDs allows the identification of different reaction products, like fragments which are mainly related to the chemical dissociation of FIrpic molecules during the OLED operation. We present different reaction pathways of the blue emitter FIrpic. One proposed reaction indicates that the short lifetimes of the OLEDs may be related to the irreversible dissociation of the FIrpic molecule by the loss of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the picolinate ligand. Additionally, the formation of chemical complexes between different fragments of the FIrpic molecules with their neighbour materials is visible. The cesium adducts of FIrpic formation indicate a possible contribution of the dopant to the OLED degradation process. Finally, we show rearrangement effects in the Cs doped electron transporting layer. This rearrangement is indicated by the presence of m/z signals of the BPhen dimer and adducts of the dimer with Cs.},

abstract = {The photodegradation behavior of four well-established iridium emitters was investigated. Irradiation of the samples in different solvents and under atmospheric as well as inert conditions helped to identify several pathways that can contribute to the deterioration of these compounds. Degradation via singlet oxygen or the excited states of the emitters as well as the detrimental influence of halogenated solvents are discussed for the different investigated iridium complexes. Some of the resulting degradation products could be identified by using LC-MS or other analytical techniques. The results show how even small structural changes can have a huge influence on rate and mechanism of the photodegradation. The observations from this study may help to better understand degradation processes occurring during the handling of the materials, but also during device processing and operation.},

@article{Erickson2014,
abstract = {Previous studies have identified triplet-triplet annihilation and triplet-polaron quenching as the exciton density-dependent mechanisms which give rise to the efficiency roll-off observed in phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). In this work, these quenching processes are independently probed, and the impact of the exciton recombination zone width on the severity of quenching in various OLED architectures is examined directly. It is found that in devices employing a graded-emissive layer (G-EML) architecture the efficiency roll-off is due to both triplet-triplet annihilation and triplet-polaron quenching, while in devices which employ a conventional double-emissive layer (D-EML) architecture, the roll-off is dominated by triplet-triplet annihilation. Overall, the efficiency roll-off in G-EML devices is found to be much less severe than in the D-EML device. This result is well accounted for by the larger exciton recombination zone measured in G-EML devices, which serves to reduce exciton density-driven loss pathways at high excitation levels. Indeed, a predictive model of the device efficiency based on the quantitatively measured quenching parameters shows the role a large exciton recombination zone plays in mitigating the roll-off.},

@article{Wehrmeister2015,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for a comprehensive analysis of the efficiency roll-off with current density in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By combining electrical and optical excitation in time-resolved spectroscopic experiments, we are able to measure the excited-state lifetime for different driving conditions. It is, thus, possible to correlate changes of the triplet lifetime with a decrease of the radiative quantum efficiency of the emitting system due to exciton quenching processes. As compared to the conventional analysis of the measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) in dependence of the applied current density, the lifetime analysis is not affected by changes of the charge-carrier balance with current, which can have a significant impact on the interpretation of the results. By performing time-resolved spectroscopy for a series of red phosphorescent OLEDs, triplet-polaron quenching (TPQ) is identified as the dominant mechanism behind the efficiency roll-off up to a current density of 100 mA/cm2, while the conventional EQE vs current plot rather suggests triplet-triplet annihilation as the main quenching mechanism. We show that this apparent discrepancy is caused by exciton quenching occurring already at very low current densities, where EQE measurements are not reliable due to significant changes of the charge-carrier balance in this region. In addition, we present evidence that the triplet-polaron quenching rate $\Gamma$TPQ is independent of the microcavity so that variations of the triplet lifetimes of a series of devices exhibiting different layer thicknesses can be described with a single parameter set.},

@article{Lamansky2001a,
abstract = {The preparation, photophysics, and solid state structures of octahedral organometallic Ir complexes with several different cyclometalated ligands are reported. IrCl3.nH2O cleanly cyclometalates a number of different compounds (i.e., 2-phenylpyridine, 2-(p-tolyl)pyridine, benzoquinoline, 2-phenylbenzothiazole, 2-(1-naphthyl)benzothiazole, and 2-phenylquinoline), forming the corresponding chloride-bridged dimers, CwedgeN2Ir(mu-Cl)2IrCwedgeN2 (CwedgeNis a cyclometalated ligand) in good yield. These chloride-bridged dimers react with acetyl acetone (acacH) and other bidentate, monoanionic ligands such as picolinic acid (picH) and N-methylsalicylimine (salH), to give monomeric CwedgeN2Ir(LX) complexes (LX = acac, pic, sal). The emission spectra of these complexes are largely governed by the nature of the cyclometalating ligand, leading to lambda(max) values from 510 to 606 nm for the complexes reported here. The strong spin-orbit coupling of iridium mixes the formally forbidden 3MLCT and 3pi-pi* transitions with the allowed 1MLCT, leading to a strong phosphorescence with good quantum efficiencies (0.1-0.4) and room temperature lifetimes in the microsecond regime. The emission spectra of the CwedgeN2Ir(LX) complexes are surprisingly similar to the fac-IrCwedgeN3 complex of the same ligand, even though the structures of the two complexes are markedly different. The crystal structures of two of the CwedgeN2Ir(acac) complexes (i.e., CwedgeN = ppy and tpy) have been determined. Both complexes show cis-C,C', trans-N,N' disposition of the two cyclometalated ligands, similar to the structures reported for other complexes with a "CwedgeN2Ir" fragment. NMR data (1H and 13C) support a similar structure for all of the CwedgeN2Ir(LX) complexes. Close intermolecular contacts in both (ppy)2Ir(acac) and (tpy)2Ir(acac) lead to significantly red shifted emission spectra for crystalline samples of the ppy and tpy complexes relative to their solution spectra.},

Usually, highly efficient white OLEDs are designed by combining three phosphorescent emitters for the colors blue, green, and red. However, this procedure is not ideal as it is difficult to find sufficiently stable blue phosphorescent emitters. Here, a novel approach to meet the demanding power efficiency and device stability requirements is discussed: a triplet harvesting concept for hybrid white OLED, which combines a blue fluorophor with red and green phosphors and is capable of reaching an internal quantum efficiency of 100{\%} if a suitable blue emitter with high-lying triplet transition is used is introduced. Additionally, this concept paves the way towards an extremely simple white OLED design, using only a single emitter layer.},

abstract = {The combination of both very high brightness and deep blue emission from phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLED) is required for both display and lighting applications, yet so far has not been reported. A source of this difficulty is the absence of electron/exciton blocking layers (EBL) that are compatible with the high triplet energy of the deep blue dopant and the high frontier orbital energies of hosts needed to transport charge. Here, we show that N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Ir(III) complexes can serve as both deep blue emitters and efficient hole-conducting EBLs. The NHC EBLs enable very high brightness ({\textgreater}7,800 cd m(-2)) operation, while achieving deep blue emission with colour coordinates of [0.16, 0.09], suitable for most demanding display applications. We find that both the facial and the meridional isomers of the dopant have high efficiencies that arise from the unusual properties of the NHC ligand-that is, the complexes possess a strong metal-ligand bond that destabilizes the non-radiative metal-centred ligand-field states. Our results represent an advance in blue-emitting PHOLED architectures and materials combinations that meet the requirements of many critical illumination applications.},

In view of the important roles of organic components in the stability and lifetime of OLEDs, we initiated an investigation of the operational degradation of CBP in OLEDs in an effort to elucidate the degradation mechanism. Our experimental approach to this task is by performing photochemistry on CBP in solution, thereby avoiding actual operation of CBP-based OLEDs. Prior to the experiments, we calculated the C-N homolytic bond dissociation energy in CBP, and synthesized two CBP derivatives based on molecular engineering considerations. Furthermore, we performed TiO2 photocatalytic decomposition of arylamines as a feasibility test for another operational degradation pathway. Based on both the photochemical and photocatalytic experiments, multiple operational degradation pathways of arylamines emerge.},

abstract = {Photophysical properties are reported for a series of cyclometalated platinum and iridium complexes that can serve as photosensitizers for singlet oxygen. The complexes have the formula (C;N)(2)Ir(O;O) or (C;N)Pt(O;O) where C;N is a monoanionic cyclometalating ligand such as 2-(phenyl)pyridyl and 2-(phenyl)quinolyl, and O;O is the ancillary ligand acetylacetonate (acac) or dipivaloylmethane (dpm). Also examined were a series of (N;N)PtMe(2) complexes where N;N is a diimine such as 2,2'-bipyridyl. In general, the cyclometalated complexes are excellent photosensitizers for the production of singlet oxygen, while the (N;N)PtMe(2) complexes were ineffective at this reaction. Quantum yields of singlet oxygen production range from 0.9-1.0 for the cyclometalated Pt complexes and 0.5-0.9 for Ir complexes. Luminescence quenching and singlet oxygen formation of the Ir complexes occurs from a combination of electron and energy transfer processes, whereas the Pt complexes only react by energy transfer. For Ir complexes with low emission energy, physical deactivation of the triplet excited state becomes competitive with energy transfer to ground state dioxygen. The rates of singlet oxygen quenching for the complexes presented here are in the range 6 x 10(6)-2 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1) for Pt complexes and 2 x 10(5)-2 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1) for Ir complexes, respectively. Differences in the efficiency of both forming and quenching singlet oxygen between the Ir and Pt cyclometalates are believed to come about from the more exposed coordination geometry in the latter species.},

abstract = {We study triplet exciton diffusion in the archetype organic material 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (CBP) commonly used as a conductive host in the emissive zone of organic light emitting devices. Using time-resolved spectral decay ensuing from the diffusion of an initially localized triplet population to a spatially separated phosphor doped region, we model the delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence decays based on non-dispersive triplet transport. Fits to the model yield a diffusion coefficient of D = (1.4 ± 0.3) × 10-8 cm2/s, and a triplet-triplet bimolecular quenching rate constant of KTT = (1.6 ± 0.4) × 10-14 cm3/s. The results are extended by doping a wide energy-gap molecule into CBP that serves to frustrate triplet transport, lowering both the diffusion coefficient and annihilation rate. These results are used to model a recently demonstrated white organic light emitting device that depends on triplet diffusion in CBP to excite spatially separate fluorescent and phosphorescent doped regions of the emissive layer. We determine the extent to which diffusion contributes to light emission in this structure, and predict its performance based on ideal lumophores with unity quantum yield. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {It has been found in recent measurements that the singlet-to-triplet exciton ratio in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is larger than expected from spin degeneracy, and that singlet excitons form at a larger rate than triplets. We employed the technique of optically detected magnetic resonance to measure the spin-dependent exciton formation rates in films of a polymer and corresponding monomer, and explore the relation between the formation rates and the actual singlet-to-triplet ratio measured previously in OLEDs. We found that the spin-dependent exciton formation rates can indeed quantitatively explain the observed exciton yields, and that singlet formation rates and yields are significantly enhanced only in polymer OLEDs, but not in OLEDs made from the corresponding monomer.},

At room temp., the lower triplet CT state is found to be the predominantly populated excited state, and the zero-zero energy of this state is found to be 2.72 eV from the onset of its emission at 80 K. The tunable emission max. of [Cu(dnbp)(DPEPhos)]BF4 in various hosts with different triplet energies is explained in terms of the multiple triplet energy levels of this complex in amorphous films. Using the high triplet energy charge transport material as a host and an exciton-blocking layer (EBL), a [Cu(dnbp)(DPEPhos)]BF4 based org. light-emitting diode (OLED) achieves a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.0{\%}, which is comparable to values for similar devices based on Ir(ppy)3 and FIrpic.

In the neat film a red-shifted phosphorescent excimer emission is observed. In diluted solid solution (polystyrene and dicarbazole-biphenyl films) as well as in de-aerated liquid solutions (tetrahydrofuran, toluene, chloroform) high phosphorescence quantum yields are obtained. In air-saturated liquid solutions, the phosphorescence efficiency is reduced by oxygen quenching.

abstract = {Numerical methods have been used to solve the bipolar current problem for a single emitting layer between electrodes with explicit injection characteristics. We consider ohmic and tunneling contacts at the anode and/or cathode for various ratios of hole to electron mobility. Diffusion is included and found to have minimal effect on the recombination efficiency. The recombination profile is dictated mainly by the ratio of mobilities, less so by contacts. Maximum efficiency is obtained for two ohmic contacts. When the injection is imbalanced, higher efficiencies are achieved when the majority carrier has the lower mobility. At sufficiently high voltages, the current tends towards balance, allowing for maximum efficiency. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

Based on reports of similar phenomena in other materials, we attribute this effect to the exciton diffusion between energetically dissimilar molecules by means of F{\"{o}}rster transfer. In analyzing results at 295, 180, 75, and 35 K, we show that existing theoretical treatments of exciton diffusion require two modifications to self-consistently fit our data: one must include spatial disorder in the model, and the energy dependence of F{\"{o}}rster transfer must be calculated using the donor-acceptor spectral overlap, instead of a Boltzman distribution. Monte Carlo simulations utilizing these changes yield results that are self-consistent with the observed spectral shifts.},

The capacitively measured electronic permittivity also increases from epsilon=2.4 to epsilon=5.6 with CA concentration. These results are consistent with the theory of solvatochromism developed for organic molecules in liquid solvents. To our knowledge, this work is the first application of a quantitative theory of solvation to organic molecules in amorphous thin films with continuously controllable permittivity, and demonstrates that "solid state solvation" can be used to predictably tune exciton energies in organic thin film structures.},

abstract = {The main process responsible for the luminance degradation in organic light-emitting diodes OLEDs driven under constant current has not yet been identified. In this paper, we propose an approach to describe the intrinsic mechanisms involved in the OLED aging. We first show that a stretched exponential decay can be used to fit almost all the luminance versus time curves obtained under different driving conditions. In this way, we are able to prove that they can all be described by employing a single free parameter model. By using an approach based on local relaxation events, we will demonstrate that a single mechanism is responsible for the dominant aging process. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that the main relaxation event is the annihilation of one emissive center. We then use our model to fit all the experimental data measured under different driving condition, and show that by carefully fitting the accelerated luminance lifetime-curves, we can extrapolate the low-luminance lifetime needed for real display applications, with a high degree of accuracy},

abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have emerged as cheaper alternatives to high-performance phosphorescent OLEDs with noble-metal-based dopants. However, the efficiencies of blue TADF OLEDs are still low at high luminance, limiting full-colour display. Here, we report a blue OLED containing a 9,10-dihydroacridine/diphenylsulphone derivative that has a comparable performance to today's best phosphorescent OLEDs. The device offers an external quantum efficiency of 19.5{\%} and reduced efficiency roll-off characteristics at high luminance. Through computational simulation, we identified six pretwisted intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) molecules with small singlet-triplet CT state splitting but different energy relationships between 3CT and locally excited triplet (3LE) states. Systematic comparison of their excited-state dynamics revealed that CT molecules with a large twist angle can emit efficient and short-lifetime (a few microseconds) TADF when the emission peak energy is high enough and the 3LE state is higher than the 3CT state.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that large-area organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) exhibit slow dynamic response due to their capacitor-like behaviors. In particular, the discharge dynamics of large-area OLEDs is observed to be relatively slower, compared with the charge dynamics. To find ways to increase the response speed of large-area OLEDs, we make an in-depth study of transient electroluminescence (EL) of OLEDs in response to voltage pulses (i.e., pulse separation), device configurations (i.e., device length), and various material parameters (e.g., carrier mobility, exciton lifetime, and energy level offset). The EL response speed can be increased by applying high bias voltage and reducing the device length. Meanwhile, the pulse separation affects the response speed of the second pulse. As the pulse separation is decreased, the ratio of the delay time of the second pulse to the delay time of the first pulse is found to be reduced, whereas the ratio of the peak luminance of the second pulse to the peak one of the first pulse is getting increased. We have also shown that the dependence of the delay time on the carrier mobility, exciton lifetime, and energy level offset is less pronounced. This study may provide design guidelines of OLEDs for practical applications including ac-driven displays and next-generation visible-light communications (VLCs).},

abstract = {Both polarons and excitons, which are composite particles with internal lattice structure, play an important role in the transport and light-emitting properties of conjugated polymers for the use in, e.g., polymer based light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The scattering and recombination processes between a triplet exciton and a polaron are investigated using a nonadiabatic evolution method based on an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model including interchain interactions. The results show that an excited polaron state can be formed, besides a triplet exciton is converted into a singlet exciton by the polaron. Moreover, the yields of both the singlet exciton and the excited polaron states increase with increasing interchain coupling strength. The excited polaron is luminescent due to radiative decay as is the singlet exciton. Therefore, our results indicate that the quantum efficiency of polymer LEDs could be enhanced by polaron-exciton recombination.},

In ambient atmosphere non-encapsulated devices show a lifetime of about 70h in pulsed operation at an initial luminance of 500 cd/m2, almost four times longer than in dc operation. A fast initial decay of luminance is observed for dc operation. It is most probably due to a combination of Joule heating and mobile ionic impurities migration within the OLED structure under the continuous forward electric field. We study also the transient electroluminescence (EL) and report the observation of a short duration spike in the leading edge of the EL response. Its origin is attributed to the temporal shift of the recombination zone in the AlQ layer from the bulk to the interface with TPD subsequent the application of a voltage step. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted much attention in research and industry thanks to their capability to emit light with high efficiency and to deliver high-quality white light that provides good color rendering. OLEDs feature homogeneous large area emission and can be produced on flexible substrates. In terms of efficiency, OLEDs can compete with highly efficient conventional light sources but their efficiency typically decreases at high brightness levels, an effect known as efficiency roll-off. In recent years, much effort has been undertaken to understand the underlying processes and to develop methods that improve the high-brightness performance of OLEDs. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and provide a detailed description of the relevant principles, both for phosphorescent and fluorescent emitter molecules. In particular, we focus on exciton-quenching mechanisms, such as triplet-triplet annihilation, quenching by polarons, or field-induced quenching, but also discuss mechanisms such as changes in charge carrier balance. We further review methods that may reduce the roll-off and thus enable OLEDs to be used in high-brightness applications.},

abstract = {The degradation mechanisms of phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PhOLEDs) are studied. The results show that PhOLED degradation is closely linked to interactions between excitons and positive polarons in the host material of the emitter layer (EML), which lead to its aggregation near the EML/electron transport layer (ETL) interface. This exciton-polaron-induced aggregation (EPIA) is associated with the emergence of new emission bands at longer wavelengths in the electroluminescence spectra of these materials, which can be detected after prolonged device operation. Such EPIA processes are found to occur in a variety of wide-bandgap materials commonly used as hosts in PhOLEDs and are correlated with device degradation. Quite notably, the extent of EPIA appears to correlate with the material's bandgap rather than with the glass-transition temperature. The findings uncover a new degradation mechanism, caused by polaron-exciton interactions, that appears to be behind the lower stability of OLEDs utilizing wide-bandgap materials in general. The same degradation mechanism can be expected to be present in other organic optoelectronic devices. Exciton-polaron-induced aggregation occurs in a variety of wide-bandgap materials commonly used as host materials in phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PhOLEDs). Such an aggregation process is determined to play a major role in limiting the electroluminescence stability of PhOLEDs. The extent of aggregation correlates with the material's bandgap rather than with the glass-transition temperature. {\textcopyright} 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

Two different PhOLEDs, one with a single host, 4,4′-Bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl, and the other with an exciplex-forming co-host, are studied. Trap-assisted recombination with a large number of trapped charges is dominant in the PhOLED with the single host because of the large energy gap between the host and the dopant state. In contrast, bimolecular Langevin recombination is dominant in the PhOLED with the exciplex forming co-host, where a phosphorescent dye is doped in the co-host. As a result, the accumulated charge density is lower in the co-host system than in the single host emission layer, leading to high efficiency that approaches the theoretical limit, with an extremely low efficiency roll-off.},

abstract = {Detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of the pulsed excitation of polymer light emitting diodes is presented. We find a set of universal transient features for a variety of device configurations (different polymers/cathodes) which can be reproduced using our phenomenological numerical model. We find that the temporal evolution of the electroluminescence in response to a step voltage pulse is characterized by: (i) a delay followed by; (ii) a fast initial rise at turn-on followed by; (iii) a slow rise (slower by at least one order of magnitude). The large mobility mismatch between holes and electrons in conjugated polymers allows us to separately time resolve the motion of holes and electrons. We suggest a method for extracting mobility values that takes into account the possible field-induced broadening of carrier fronts, and which is found to be compatible with mobilities determined from constant wave measurements. By using appropriate device configurations it is possible to determine the mobilities of both holes and electrons from a single device. Mobilities for holes and electrons are extracted for a poly(p-phenylenevinylene) copolymer and poly(di-octyl fluorene). (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics. [S0021-8979(99)07621-5].},

abstract = {A study has been made of the electronic transitions between the lowest triplet state of anthracene and its ground state. Low‐temperature spectroscopic study of the phosphorescence revealed a sharp emission band with a 0,0‐frequency (T→S) at 14 927 cm—1 (EPA rigid glass solution at 77°K). A vibrational analysis in terms of known Raman frequencies indicates that the transition is of a u→g allowed type. The T←S absorption band was observed in anthracene with the 0,0‐frequency at 14 850 cm—1 (solution at 293°K). The study of the phosphorescence spectra of seven different chlorinated anthracenes confirmed the assignment of the anthracene lowest triplet. This study re‐establishes the earlier value obtained by Lewis and Kasha, and rejects the recent value deduced by Reid. A correlation of the above results for anthracene with calculations and observations on related polyacenes indicates that the lowest triplet of benzene is 3 B 1u (in D 6h ), and for naphthalene, anthracene, and naphthacene the lowest triplet is 3 B 2u (in D 2h ). The perturbing singlets which mix with these triplets are obtained from previously derived rules for spin‐orbital coupling in molecules.},

Using single layers devices, the optical response and the half-lifetime behavior of the materials are investigated. Layers of FIr6 exposed to UV-light show the formation of a red emitting degradation product. We analyze the chemical reactions of the materials using laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Several products related to the chemical dissociation of the FIr6 molecule as well as charge complex formation between the emitter and the emitter dissociation products are detected. FIr6 and FIrpic are also compared by lifetime studies on commonly used OLED structures. We show that single layers and OLEDs based on FIrpic exhibit higher stability than those based on FIr6. An explanation for this behavior can be found by considering the chemical structure of the molecules. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We examine electron transport in the archetype amorphous organic material tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3). It is established that for Al, LiF/Al, and Mg:Ag cathodes, injection processes at the metal/organic contact dominate the current-voltage characteristics. We find that transport is also injection-limited at low temperatures, but that the cathode dependence of current-voltage characteristics at T=30 K is substantially reduced, raising doubts over metal-to-organic injection models that depend on the cathode work function. Given that ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show a shift in the vacuum potential at the metal/Alq3 interface of ∼1 eV, we investigate the impact of interfacial dipoles on adjacent molecules in the organic film. Consequently, we propose that injection is limited by charge hopping out of interfacial molecular sites whose energy distribution is broadened by local disorder in the interfacial dipole field. We derive a general analytic model of injection from interfacial states and find that it accurately predicts the current-voltage characteristics of transport in Alq3 over many orders of magnitude in current and over a wide range of temperatures. The model is extended to other amorphous organic semiconductors and is found to be applicable to both polymers and small molecular weight organic compounds.},

abstract = {We review the device and materials science behind organic electroluminescent diodes made both using discrete evaporable molecules and spin-cast organic polymers. A great deal of progress has been made in improving the efficiencies and spectral properties of organic light-emitting diodes, and these are now adequate for many applications. More work is necessary to understand the stability and degradation of emissive and charge-transporting organics, but some systems have been shown to be stable for 10(4) hours at display brightness. Major challenges still face the community in terms of developing satisfactory systems design and processing techniques if organic electroluminescence is to realize either performance or economic advantages over technologies and significantly penetrate the display market. We present an analysis of the suitability of organic light-emitting diodes for various applications, and consider the materials and manufacturing obstacles that must be overcome.},

abstract = {Abstract Time resolved photoluminescence and electroluminescence measurements are used to study changes in the emission characteristics of materials typically used in phosphorescent organic light emitting devices (PhOLEDs). Studies on archetypical PhOLEDs with phosphorescent material, fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium (Ir(ppy)3), show that the lifetime of triplet exciton is modified when in close proximity to a metal layer. Interactions with a metal layer ∼30–100 nm away, as is typically the case in PhOLEDs, result in an increase in the spontaneous emission decay rate of triplet excitons, and causes the exciton lifetime to become shorter as the distance between the phosphorescent material and the metal becomes smaller. The phenomenon, possibly the result of the confined radiation field by the metal, affects device efficiency and efficiency roll-off behavior. The results shed the light on phenomena affecting the efficiency behavior of PhOLEDs, and provide new insights for device design that can help enhance efficiency performance.},

In the past bamboo could have been used for the reeds as well as the pipes, but metal reeds have been used extensively for some time. Measurements have been made on reeds and pipes from two khaen: one a high quality instrument made in northeastern Thailand and one an inexpensive khaen purchased at an import shop.

@article{Coehoorn2015,
abstract = {The performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is determined by a complex interplay of the optoelectronic processes in the active layer stack. In order to enable simulation-assisted layer stack development, a three-dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo OLED simulation method which includes the charge transport and all excitonic processes is developed. In this paper, the results are presented of simulations including degradation processes in idealized but realizable phosphorescent OLEDs. Degradation is treated as a result of the conversion of emitter molecules to non-emissive sites upon a triplet-polaron quenching (TPQ) process. Under the assumptions made, TPQ provides the dominant contribution to the roll-off. There is therefore a strong relationship between the roll-off and the lifetime. This is quantified using a “uniform density model”, within which the charge carrier and exciton densities are assumed to be uniform across the emissive layer. The simulations give rise to design rules regarding the energy levels, and are used to study the sensitivity of the roll-off and lifetime to various other materials parameters, including the mobility, the phosphorescent dye concentration, the triplet exciton emissive lifetime and binding energy, and the type of TPQ process.},

abstract = {This article describes the first systematic investigation of how the efficiency roll-off in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is influenced by the position and orientation of the emitter molecules within the OLED cavity. The efficiency roll-off is investigated for two OLED stacks containing either the phosphorescent emitter Ir(MDQ)2(acac) or Ir(ppy)3 by varying the distance between emitter and metal cathode; a strong influence of emitter position and orientation on roll-off is observed. The measurements are modeled by triplet-triplet-annihilation (TTA) theory yielding the critical current density and the TTA rate constant. It is found that Ir(MDQ)2(acac) shows the lowest roll-off when the emitter is located in the first optical maximum of the electromagnetic field, whereas the roll-off of the Ir(ppy)3 stack is lowest when the emitter is positioned closer to the metal cathode. Measurement and modeling of time-resolved electroluminescence show that the different roll-off behavior is due to the different orientation and the corresponding change of the decay rate of the emissive dipoles of Ir(MDQ)2(acac) and Ir(ppy)3. Finally, design principles are developed for optimal high-brightness performance by modeling the roll-off as a function of emitter-cathode distance, emissive dipole orientation, and radiative efficiency.},

abstract = {Study of the transient electroluminescence (EL) behavior at turn-on upon the application of a single voltage pulse is presented. Based on the continuity equations which describe the carrier dynamics, and on the recombination current which describe the EL output, we present a theoretical model to explain the slow rise of the EL associated to the electron packet motion in the bulk. The model enables us to determine, more than the mobility of majority carriers, the equilibrium density of free holes in the bulk. The dependence of free hole density (pe) of the applied voltage shows that the unipolar current flow for holes in the bulk follows as expected, an SCLC regime characterized by a linear dependence of pe with applied voltage. Our analysis allows us also to estimate the trap density (for holes) in the bulk of about 2 ?? 1015 cm-3. Both experimental and theoretical results are compared to each other and to other works, and were found to be consistent with the proposed model. The device under investigation is the conventional ITO/MEH-PPV/Al OLED. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Based on this analysis, we demonstrate that the lasing duration can be extended to nearly 100 µs, ultimately limited by degradation of the lasing medium when a “triplet manager” molecule, 9,10-di(naphtha-2-yl)anthracene, is blended into the gain region of an otherwise conventional distributed feedback OSL. The triplet manager facilitates radiative singlet transfer while suppressing nonradiative triplet transfer to the emitter molecule, thus reducing the triplet-induced losses. Our theory conclusively shows that these lasers have entered the CW lasing regime.},

To fully exploit the potential of this acceptor molecule with respect to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells, the short circuit current (J(SC)) should be improved to become competitive with the state of the art solar cells. Here, we address factors influencing the J(SC) in blends containing the high voltage absorber Lu(3)N@C(80)-PCBEH in view of both photogeneration but also transport and extraction of charge carriers. We apply optical, charge carrier extraction, morphology, and spin-sensitive techniques. In blends containing Lu(3)N@C(80)-PCBEH, we found 2 times weaker photoluminescence quenching, remainders of interchain excitons, and, most remarkably, triplet excitons formed on the polymer chain, which were absent in the reference P3HT:PC(61)BM blends. We show that electron back transfer to the triplet state along with the lower exciton dissociation yield due to intramolecular charge transfer in Lu(3)N@C(80)-PCBEH are responsible for the reduced photocurrent.},

The FIrpic-based OLED exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency of 10.4{\%}, corresponding to a current efficiency of 20.4 cd/A, and a maximum power efficiency of 10.5 lm/W. The efficiency was drastically improved compared to that of a previously reported FIrpic-based OLED.

@article{Kondakov2003,
abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are attractive for display applications because of their high brightness, low driving voltage, and tunable color. Their operating lifetimes, hundreds or thousands of hours, are sufficient for only a limited range of applications. The luminance efficiency decreases gradually as the device is operated (electrically aged), for reasons that are poorly understood. A prototypical OLED has the structure anode$\backslash$HTL$\backslash$ETL$\backslash$cathode, where the HTL and ETL are hole- and electron-transporting layers, and the recombination and emission occur at or near the HTL$\backslash$ETL interface. We find that the decreasing luminance efficiency is linearly correlated with an accumulation of immobile positive charge at the HTL$\backslash$ETL interface, and the magnitude of the charge is comparable to the total charge at that interface when an unaged device is operated. A natural explanation of the connection between the two phenomena is that electrical aging either generates hole traps (and trapped holes) or drives metal ions into the device, and that either species act as nonradiative recombination centers. To estimate the accumulating immobile charge and determine its location, we use a variant of a recently introduced capacitance versus voltage technique. In the prototypical OLEDs described here, the HTL is a ca. 1000 Angstrom layer of NPB, and the ETL is a 300-1800 Angstrom layer of Alq(3). A device with an additional "emission layer" (EML) of an anthracene derivative between the HTL and ETL, in which the electroluminescence spectrum is characteristic of the EML, behaved similarly. We surmise that the phenomena reported here may be common to a wider variety of OLED structures and compositions. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {This work focuses on the effect of light exposure on ITO/organic interface in organic optoelectronic devices, including organic light emitting devices (OLEDs), organic photo-detectors (OPDs) and organic solar cells (OSCs). The results show that irradiation by light in the visible and UV range leads to a gradual deterioration in charge injection and extraction across the interface. A correlation between the performance stability of the devices and the photo-stability of the ITO/organic contacts is established. Studies also show that this photo-induced degradation can be significantly reduced by means of ITO surface treatment or through the insertion of interfacial layers between ITO and the organic layers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements reveal detectable changes in the interface characteristics after irradiation, indicating that the photo-degradation of the ITO/organic contacts is chemical in nature. Changes in XPS characteristics after irradiation suggest a possible reduction in bonds between ITO and its adjacent organic layer. The results shed light on a new material degradation mechanism that appears to have a wide presence in ITO/organic contacts in general, and which may play a key role in limiting the stability of various organic optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs, OSCs and OPDs. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In Zr50Cu35Al15, the poorer glass former, the crystal-like structure is more stable under annealing below the glass transition temperature, Tg, than in Zr50Cu45Al5. Variable resolution fluctuation microscopy of the MRO clusters show that in Zr50Cu35Al15 on sub-Tg annealing, the crystal-like clusters shrink even as they grow more ordered, while icosahedral-like clusters grow. Overall, the results suggest that achieving better glass forming ability in this alloy system may depend more on destabilizing crystal-like structures than enhancing non-crystalline structures.},

Here, using polarization- and wavelength-dependent photoconductivity in the highly ordered organic semiconductor rubrene, we show that the diffusion of triplet excitons in this material occurs over macroscopic distances (2-8 $\mu$m), comparable to the light absorption length. Dissociation of these excitons at the surface of the crystal is found to be the main source of photoconductivity in rubrene. In addition, we observe strong photoluminescence quenching and a simultaneous enhancement of photoconductivity when the crystal surface is functionalized with exciton splitters. In combination with time-resolved measurements, these observations strongly suggest that long-lived triplet excitons are indeed generated in molecular crystals by fission of singlets, and these triplets provide a significant contribution to the surface photocurrent generated in organic materials. Our findings indicate that the exciton diffusion bottleneck is not an intrinsic limitation of organic semiconductors.},

Electroluminescence efficiency roll-off at high current density is dramatically suppressed using ACRXTN as an emitter instead of 2CzPN because of suppressed bimolecular exciton annihilation processes such as singlet-triplet and triplet-triplet annihilation. The rate constant of reverse intersystem crossing from triplet to singlet excited states of ACRXTN is about 300 times higher than that of 2CzPN, decreasing triplet exciton density and suppressing exciton annihilation processes under optical and electrical excitation.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider some of the consequences of the mixing of neutral exciton states (neutral excitation waves or Frenkel excitons) with charge-transfer exciton states (ion-pair excitons) in the oriented gas model of aromatic molecular crystals.The lowest-energy charge-transfer exciton is described by suitable symmetry-adapted functions built on the basis functions of a near-neighbor positive and negative ion pair. It is then shown that the energy of this state is not greatly different from the p states of anthracene and naphthalene, and therefore that the ion-pair exciton and Frenkel exciton states can mix. For the cases of anthracene and naphthalene, such configuration interaction leads to the following contributions to the Davydov splitting of the triplet manifold...  In making the computations, it is necessary to consider carefully the effects of vibronic coupling and of configuration changes in the excited state. It is concluded that charge-transfer excitons can make an important contribution to the Davydov splitting of a triplet manifold. This conclusion is supported by preliminary estimates of the interaction matrix elements for crystalline benzene.},

Upon LDI measurements, this class of materials does not show any photochemical reactions. The second part of the work deals with two typical electron conductive materials: tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)-aluminum (Alq3) and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BPhen). These materials show photochemical reactions in terms of oligomerization. The individual reaction pathways will be discussed in detail. We compare these reactions by further studying two similar molecules (1,1′-biphenyl-4′-oxy)bis(8-hydroxy-2-methylquinolinato)-aluminum (BAlq) and bathocuproine (BCP). Finally, we discuss a possible relation of the results to degradation mechanisms taking place in organic devices.},

Notable examples of chiral inorganic nanostructures include carbon nanotubes, gold multishell nanowires, mesoporous nanowires and helical nanowires. Branched nanostructures have also been studied and been shown to have interesting properties for energy harvesting and nanoelectronics. Combining both chiral and branching motifs into nanostructures might provide new materials properties. Here we show a chiral branched PbSe nanowire structure, which is formed by a vapour-liquid-solid branching from a central nanowire with an axial screw dislocation. The chirality is caused by the elastic strain of the axial screw dislocation, which produces a corresponding Eshelby Twist in the nanowires. In addition to opening up new opportunities for tailoring the properties of nanomaterials, these chiral branched nanowires also provide a direct visualization of the Eshelby Twist.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of the operational lifetime of organic light-emitting diodes(OLEDs) in practical applications, little is known about the nature of chemical reactions associated with efficiency losses during operation. To gain an insight into a chemical mechanism of operational degradation, we studied operation-induced changes in chemical compositions of fluorescent and phosphorescent OLEDs utilizing carbazole derivatives in emissive layers. We detected substantial losses of the emissive components, including the carbazole-derived host 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (CBP) and, if present, phosphorescent dopant. Several different materials were found only in the degraded OLEDs, and some of them were isolated and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. A similar set of products was found upon UV irradiation of CBP films. Structures of degradation products suggest that the key step in operational degradation of OLEDs is homolytic cleavage of weaker bonds, e.g., an exocyclic C–N bond in CBP, in the excited state, followed by radical addition reactions to yield stabilized $\pi$ radicals. Overall, OLED operation leads to the accumulation of the neutral radical species and their reduced or oxidized forms, acting as nonradiative recombination centers and luminescence quenchers.},

In this paper, we propose an approach to describe the intrinsic mechanisms involved in the OLED aging. We first show that a stretched exponential decay can be used to fit almost all the luminance versus time curves obtained under different driving conditions. In this way, we are able to prove that they can all be described by employing a single free parameter model. By using an approach based on local relaxation events, we will demonstrate that a single mechanism is responsible for the dominant aging process. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that the main relaxation event is the annihilation of one emissive center. We then use our model to fit all the experimental data measured under different driving condition, and show that by carefully fitting the accelerated luminance lifetime-curves, we can extrapolate the low-luminance lifetime needed for real display applications, with a high degree of accuracy.},

In a single reactor, silicon nanocrystals are synthesized, surface-functionalized, and deposited onto substrates precoated with a transparent electrode. Devices are completed by evaporation of a top metal electrode. The devices exhibit electroluminescence centered at a wavelength of $\lambda$ = 836 nm with a peak external quantum efficiency exceeding 0.02{\%}. This all-gas-phase approach permits controlled deposition of dense, functional nanocrystal films suitable for application in electronic devices.},

@article{Wohlgenannt2001,
abstract = {Electroluminescence in organic light-emitting diodes arises from a charge-transfer reaction between the injected positive and negative charges by which they combine to form singlet excitons that subsequently decay radiatively. The quantum yield of this process (the number of photons generated per electron or hole injected) is often thought to have a statistical upper limit of 25 per cent. This is based on the assumption that the formation cross-section of singlet excitons, sigmaS, is approximately the same as that of any one of the three equivalent non-radiative triplet exciton states, sigmaT; that is, sigmaS/sigmaT approximately 1. However, recent experimental and theoretical work suggests that sigmaS/sigmaT may be greater than 1. Here we report direct measurements of sigmaS/sigmaT for a large number of pi-conjugated polymers and oligomers. We have found that there exists a strong systematic, but not monotonic, dependence of sigmaS/sigmaT on the optical gap of the organic materials. We present a detailed physical picture of the charge-transfer reaction for correlated pi-electrons, and quantify this process using exact valence bond calculations. The calculated sigmaS/sigmaT reproduces the experimentally observed trend. The calculations also show that the strong dependence of sigmaS/sigmaT on the optical gap is a signature of the discrete excitonic energy spectrum, in which higher energy excitonic levels participate in the charge recombination process.},

@article{Sun2006,
abstract = {Lighting accounts for approximately 22 per cent of the electricity consumed in buildings in the United States, with 40 per cent of that amount consumed by inefficient (approximately 15 lm W(-1)) incandescent lamps. This has generated increased interest in the use of white electroluminescent organic light-emitting devices, owing to their potential for significantly improved efficiency over incandescent sources combined with low-cost, high-throughput manufacturability. The most impressive characteristics of such devices reported to date have been achieved in all-phosphor-doped devices, which have the potential for 100 per cent internal quantum efficiency: the phosphorescent molecules harness the triplet excitons that constitute three-quarters of the bound electron-hole pairs that form during charge injection, and which (unlike the remaining singlet excitons) would otherwise recombine non-radiatively. Here we introduce a different device concept that exploits a blue fluorescent molecule in exchange for a phosphorescent dopant, in combination with green and red phosphor dopants, to yield high power efficiency and stable colour balance, while maintaining the potential for unity internal quantum efficiency. Two distinct modes of energy transfer within this device serve to channel nearly all of the triplet energy to the phosphorescent dopants, retaining the singlet energy exclusively on the blue fluorescent dopant. Additionally, eliminating the exchange energy loss to the blue fluorophore allows for roughly 20 per cent increased power efficiency compared to a fully phosphorescent device. Our device challenges incandescent sources by exhibiting total external quantum and power efficiencies that peak at 18.7 +/- 0.5 per cent and 37.6 +/- 0.6 lm W(-1), respectively, decreasing to 18.4 +/- 0.5 per cent and 23.8 +/- 0.5 lm W(-1) at a high luminance of 500 cd m(-2).},

abstract = {The organic/electrode interfaces in organic solar cells are systematically studied for their light, heat, and electrical stability in an inert atmosphere. Various extraction layers are examined for their effect on device stability, including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and MoO3 for hole extraction layers, as well as LiF, Cs2CO3, and lithium acetylacetonate (Liacac) for electron extraction layers. The organic/metal interface is shown to be inherently photo-unstable, resulting in significant losses in device efficiency with irradiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the organic/aluminum interface suggest that the photo-induced changes are chemical in nature. In general, interfacial layers are shown to substantially reduce photo-degradation of the active layer/electrode interface. In spite of their photo-stability, several interfacial layers present at the active layer/cathode interface suffer from thermal degradation effects due to temperature increases under exposure to light. Electrical aging effects are proven to be negligible in comparison to other major modes of degradation.},

The branching is induced by continuously feeding the PbSe reactant with the vapor of a low-melting-point metal catalyst including In, Ga, and Bi. The branches show very regular orientation relationships: either perpendicular or parallel to each other. The diameter of the individual NWs depends on the size of the catalyst droplets, which can be controlled by the catalyst vapor pressure. Significantly, the hyperbranched networks can be grown epitaxially on NaCl, a low-cost substrate for future device array applications. Electrical measurements across branched NWs show the evolution of charge carrier transport with distance and degree of branching.},

abstract = {The efficiency of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) made from organic semiconductors is determined by the fraction of injected electrons and holes that recombine to form emissive spin-singlet states rather than non-emissive spin-triplet states. If the process by which these states form is spin-independent, the maximum efficiency of organic LEDs will be limited to 25 per cent. But recent reports have indicated fractions of emissive singlet states ranging from 22 to 63 per cent, and the reason for this variation remains unclear. Here we determine the absolute fraction of singlet states generated in a platinum-containing conjugated polymer and its corresponding monomer. The spin-orbit coupling introduced by the platinum atom allows triplet-state emission, so optically and electrically generated luminescence from both singlet and triplet states can be compared directly. We find an average singlet generation fraction of 22 +/- 1 per cent for the monomer, but 57 +/- 4 per cent for the polymer. This suggests that recombination is spin-independent for the monomer, but that a spin-dependent process, favouring singlet formation, is effective in the polymer. We suggest that this process is a consequence of the exchange interaction, which will operate on overlapping electron and hole wavefunctions on the same polymer chain at their capture radius.},

abstract = {The inherent flexibility afforded by molecular design has accelerated the development of a wide variety of organic semiconductors over the past two decades. In particular, great advances have been made in the development of materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), from early devices based on fluorescent molecules to those using phosphorescent molecules. In OLEDs, electrically injected charge carriers recombine to form singlet and triplet excitons in a 1:3 ratio; the use of phosphorescent metal-organic complexes exploits the normally non-radiative triplet excitons and so enhances the overall electroluminescence efficiency. Here we report a class of metal-free organic electroluminescent molecules in which the energy gap between the singlet and triplet excited states is minimized by design, thereby promoting highly efficient spin up-conversion from non-radiative triplet states to radiative singlet states while maintaining high radiative decay rates, of more than 10(6) decays per second. In other words, these molecules harness both singlet and triplet excitons for light emission through fluorescence decay channels, leading to an intrinsic fluorescence efficiency in excess of 90 per cent and a very high external electroluminescence efficiency, of more than 19 per cent, which is comparable to that achieved in high-efficiency phosphorescence-based OLEDs.},
